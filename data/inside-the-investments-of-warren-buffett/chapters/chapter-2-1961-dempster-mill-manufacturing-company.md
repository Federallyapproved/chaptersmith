1961: Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company
Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company was founded in 1878 by Charles B. Dempster in Beatrice, Nebraska. After the Civil War, many people moved to the West to start new lives. Mr. Dempster believed that as these people settled down, they would have a need for windmills, water pumps, and other related machinery—and he wanted to be the person serving those needs.
At first, Dempster Mill was set up as a retail shop, and products were sourced through a distributor in Omaha, Nebraska. After 1885, Dempster began building its own production capabilities after Mr. Dempster decided that revenues would be even better if his company had its own brand and control over the quality of production. Between the late 1880s and the 1930s, Dempster Mill was one of several companies that pioneered the development of windmills and farm irrigation systems in the Great Plains, and many of their windmills (
figure 2.2
) became a part of the familiar farm landscape.

Windmills in those days were the primary source of energy for operating water pumps, which brought up ground water for use in irrigation, feeding of livestock, and other essential water uses in operating a farm. In this sense, the windmills and their accompanying water system machinery were integral parts of land development at the time and an important investment for any settler. Dempster Mill was not the only company in this industry, but it was one of a few successful ones that had a good reputation. In addition to windmills, Dempster also built many related water systems, such as pumps and irrigation machinery.
By the 1960s, windmills and their related accessories had declined as a market. During and after the Great Depression, federal government stimulus had helped extend the electricity grid to many parts of the rural Midwest, which in turn led to electrical pumps replacing many functions of the windmill-driven water source. The main advantage of electrical pumps was that they could be turned on whenever water was needed, whereas with the windmill-driven pumps, a farmer had only the water provided in a reservoir, which was replenished by the windmills at an unpredictable rate. Hence, electrical pumps were more convenient.
In 1961, Dempster Mill Manufacturing was a business with $9 million in sales. It was in that year that Buffett first wrote about the company in his annual letter to Buffett Partnership Limited (BPL). In his 1961 letter, Buffett comments that the partnership had been building a stake in the company for the previous five years. While Dempster Mill had originally been acquired as a general value investment, it had become a control situation. By the end of 1961, BPL owned 70 percent of the company directly and another 10 percent indirectly through associates.
Before we discuss the financials, let us quickly sum up our understanding of the inherent business quality of Dempster Mill Manufacturing based on what we know. Although Dempster Mill operated in an industry that was not growing, this industry was not one that was going away immediately. First, as with all windmill companies, there were sales of new equipment as well as spare parts and servicing (aftersales). Any business that has aftersales is one with a long tail business; that is, there is a recurring revenue stream for a long period after the original equipment is sold. This revenue stream protects the business from a quick decline. By the 1960s Dempster Mill also had diversified into other industries. In addition to its original core business of selling windmills, it sold an assortment of agricultural equipment. This equipment included seed drills (machinery used for the planting of grains) as well as fertilizer applicators (machinery used to inject liquid fertilizers into soil). While this business must have been relatively small, it would have been a growing business in the 1960s.
2
In 1961, Dempster Mill would have been mediocre but not terrible from a business quality perspective. Although its core windmill business, which had been an excellent business, was in decline, this decline was gradual because the business had services and spare parts revenue extending out for years after the original equipment was installed.
3
In addition, new products, some of which were in growing market segments, would also have given the company additional avenues to counteract the decline in its core business. Here it must be pointed out that although Dempster Mill had a strong brand name in the windmill business and few competitors, it did not enjoy such advantages in its new product categories. There were many competitors, some of whom were more well-known than Dempster Mill in the agricultural equipment space. Nevertheless, the evidence would have pointed to Dempster Mill as a business where good business execution would allow it to generate a return above its cost of capital.
Dempster Mill Manufacturing is one of the few investment cases where the Buffett Partnership Letters give us an extremely detailed account of the company’s financials.

Buffett lists the major items on the balance sheet. As
table 2.1
shows, assets including cash, accounts receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses, PPE, and other items totaled $6.92 million. On the liabilities side, considering debt, accounts payables, and other liabilities, the book value was minus $2.32 million. Going by just the balance sheet, the total value of the business was $4.6 million, which represented $76.48 per share.
Buffett took an approach reminiscent of how Benjamin Graham must have looked at many investments that were based on asset values rather than earnings. Instead of going by book value, Buffett gives us an estimate of the fair value of the business by taking significant discounts in all assets where he felt that the book value may not be conservative enough: he applied a 15 percent discount to accounts receivable and a 40 percent discount to inventory. For liabilities, however, to be conservative, he assumed 100 percent of the book value. Using this approach, Buffett estimated that the fair value of the business to be about $35 per share.
Buffett does not give the specific figures on the income and earnings level of the business, but he does give us clues. He states: “The operations for the past decade have been characterized by static sales, low inventory turnover and virtually no profits in relation to invested capital.”
This side comment on the business as one with “static sales” and “virtually no profits” is more significant than it first appears. What it means is that Dempster Mill was not a quickly deteriorating business, one that was losing cash. In fact, Dempster Mill still made a profit. As the box at the end of this chapter shows, this is consistent with the financial information from the 1960
Moody’s Industrial Manual
, which also showed that the business had positive earnings in 1958 and 1959. I will discuss why I find this significant in the next few paragraphs.
Buffett gives us the exact price he paid for Dempster Mill Manufacturing. In the 1962 year-end annual letter, he states that he began buying stock of the company several years prior at a price as low as $16 per share, and he had acquired the vast majority of his take in an off-market transaction for $30.25 in 1961. On average, the price he paid was $28 per share. At this valuation, Buffett had purchased the shares at a 63 percent discount to the book value per share and a 20 percent discount to his own conservatively calculated fair value. This is certainly a significant margin of safety.
While rare, it is not impossible to find companies that trade far below book value even today. The issue is that companies trading below book value are by no means guaranteed investments. Many times the companies that trade below book value are those that for one reason or another have net assets worth much less than what their book values may suggest.
In this particular investment case Buffett most likely saw two things very clearly. First, Dempster Mill, which could be dismissed at first glance as a dead business, was in fact not in the midst of suffering a quick collapse. The business had been stagnant and was not making much profit, but its decline was most likely gradual, and it was not bleeding cash. In fact, if anything, Dempster Mill was a business with a significant potential for operational improvements.
Moreover, the bulk of assets in this business were assets that could be sold and turned into cash. Specifically, the asset value assigned by Buffett was for the most part not in plant, property, and equipment, but rather in inventory and accounts receivables. Buffett must have known that the business would be able to realize this value within twelve to twenty-four months.
In this sense, Dempster Mill Manufacturing was in fact a classic net-net. If one adds up just its net current assets and subtract all liabilities, and then takes only two-thirds of this amount, the value would still exceed the stock price.
4
This is important because often companies that sell at great discounts to book value are companies where the book assets really have no way of being realized. An example of this would be a solar cell manufacturer who has a lot of production capacity on its books and whose replacement value could be very significant, but no one is likely to buy any of these assets because there is simply no demand for them.
In addition to purchasing a business at a great price with the reassurance that its fundamentals were not deteriorating quickly, Buffett employed a straightforward strategy. He saw an opportunity to improve operations in a company whose asset values could be realized through converting inventory to cash, and in turn, that cash could be used to invest. In order to do this, Buffett did not shy away from making this a control situation. With a 1961 year-end total asset under management of about $7.2 million, Dempster Mill represented a bit over 20 percent of the total assets of Buffett’s partnerships based on his valuation of the business at $35 per share. Again, this was a big investment.
More should also be said about the management at Dempster Mill. When Buffett initially invested in the company, the management team was, simply put, not very capable. There were clear indications that the management had not pursued operational improvement opportunities that would have seemed fairly basic. One example was that the original managers had no differentiated pricing for replacement parts and the original equipment. A standard framework for a business with spare parts is to have higher prices for those replacement parts because they are sold to a captive audience who must choose those compatible components and are therefore less price-sensitive; this framework would allow better margins. Hence, when the subsequent management team introduced a differentiated pricing model, profits immediately increased with no loss on volumes.
Even though Buffett recognized the shortcomings of the original management team, he tried to work with them toward more effective use of capital and more efficient operations. However, after repeated failures, Buffett brought in his own management: a man named Harry Bottle. Buffett would speak very positively about Bottle for the next few years in his annual letters. In his discussion of Bottle, Buffett seems to reflect how he assesses management based on three main criteria:
(a)  Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”): Harry Bottle was incentivized through clear KPIs and managed the business based on key financial metrics. These included realizing a high percent of inventory into cash; reducing selling, general, and administrative costs by 50 percent; and shutting down unprofitable branches.
(b)  Tackles “tough things first”: Harry was a man who did not shy away from necessary action including the aforementioned disposal of unprofitable facilities. He also did not wait to dispose of or write off dead merchandise.
(c)  Hardworking: Buffett described Harry Bottle as someone who was focused on the tasks at hand; “I like dealing with someone who is not trying to figure how to get the fixtures in the executive washroom gold-plated.”
The partnership letters of 1962 and 1963 reveal how Dempster’s value as calculated by Buffett’s conservative discounting method rose from $35, to $50, to $65.

Fundamental to this growth in value was Bottle’s ability to realize value from the assets at almost 100 percent of book value. A bit like in a modern private equity setup, Bottle generated cash from the working capital and used this to pay off most of the debt. Moreover, the cash generated was subsequently used to build a portfolio of securities that Buffett invested alongside his remaining investment portfolio. It seems like Buffett drew on his experience with Sanborn Maps to value the ability to use cash to invest. By the time Buffett had the chance to exit this position in late 1963 through a private transaction, the total value he was able to realize on the investment was equal to about $80 per share: a handsome profit.
Interestingly, in her biography on Buffett, Alice Schroeder reveals that this experience was also one where Buffett learned that he very much disliked playing the role of the activist investor. Despite the superb gains in this investment, the role he had to play in laying off personnel and selling off assets was one he did not want to repeat in the future.

It has been said that this experience was the beginning of Buffett’s preference for being rather hands-off, both as a manager and as an investor.
