Evolution of Buffett’s Investment Strategy
Warren Buffett’s long investment career, as exemplified by the notable investments I have reviewed, is not defined by only one type of investment or investing strategy; his approach has clearly evolved between 1957 when he started his first investment partnership and today. Retracing the journey through the characteristics of his various investments can help one understand this evolution.
Most striking about the companies Buffett invested in early on—such as the Sanborn Maps Company, Dempster Mill, or Berkshire Hathaway—is that they traded at incredibly cheap prices compared to the value of the assets they held. This did not always mean paying a low earnings multiple (say, about 5× PER). Indeed, both Sanborn Maps and Dempster Mill had little earnings at the time of Buffett’s investment and thus would have had high earnings multiples. Rather than just evaluating PER, Buffett seemed to be looking for companies that traded below the clearly realizable value of the assets they had. Sanborn Maps, for instance, had an investment portfolio worth more than the price he paid for the whole company; in Dempster Mill there was inventory that he knew was sellable; and in the case of Berkshire Hathaway, there was a combination of cash and realizable working capital.
Aside from just cheap investments, from very early in his career Buffett was focused on the fundamental businesses he invested in. He was not just interested in net-nets, but in companies that had positive earnings and (when possible) positive developments in underlying business prospects. Sanborn Maps, for example, was a business that had been in a structural decline for years due to technological change—but it was still a business making a positive profit margin and had in fact stabilized in the years preceding the investment. This means that Buffett did not have to worry about the business burning all its cash on unprofitable operations. Buffett also identified situations where there were operational improvements in the works—or where he could be a catalyst for such positive developments.
Another important aspect to Buffett’s investment strategy is that even during this early period of the partnership years, he paid keen attention to a business’s management team. Although his criteria for evaluating such teams evolved with time, in his earliest investments (such as Dempster Mill and Berkshire Hathaway) he already showed great interest in selecting great operating managers. And it should be said that Buffett, even in his early work, was not just a one-trick pony focused only on finding cheap companies. As the Texas National Petroleum investment shows, Buffett also invested in merger arbitrage situations (including in fixed income products), and his detailed analysis and understanding of the risks demonstrated his familiarity with this type of investment. He also dabbled in control investments where he took an active part in bringing change; at both Dempster Mill and Berkshire Hathaway, for example, he played a key role in influencing the operations of the business after he took over.
To summarize Buffett’s early investment strategy: He focused foremost on finding companies that were cheap in comparison to the value of realizable assets they had, but he was still familiar with other kinds of investments and pursued those when they seemed especially attractive. The real foundation for his later thinking about investments seemed to be his scrutiny of each investment case—many of them smaller businesses with tangible assets—from the lens of a business owner. He assessed both the key people and assets involved in a business, and evaluated their likely effect on the future development of the business. From the beginning, his strategy was clearly more involved than the simple Graham style calculation of net-nets.
By the middle years of his career (from 1968 to about 1990), Buffett seemed to place increasing importance on the quality of the business. He shifted from focusing on the value of a business’s assets toward evaluating its sustainable earnings power. Looking at the investments that Buffett made in this period—whether it was a private investment like See’s Candies, a turnaround situation like GEICO, or a branded franchise like Coca-Cola—the key rationale was always attractive long-term earnings. Buffett still purchased great companies at great valuations when possible, but seemed to become much more comfortable paying higher earnings multiples—15× PER in several instances—which is more than most value investors would consider.
Buffett’s definition of quality included both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quantitatively, he gravitated increasingly to those businesses with consistent growth and a high return on tangible capital employed (ROTCE). Notably, Buffett was not fixated on extremely high growth or particularly attractive valuation; rather, mid-single digit growth that was extremely consistent and driven by an understood structural cause seemed to be the key criteria. This was certainly the case with the several branded goods investments. When Buffett invested in Coca-Cola in 1987, increased global consumption had helped the company grow revenues and operating income in nine out of the previous ten years. Similarly, when he published See’s Candies financials after his purchase of the business in 1976, he showed that increasing like-for-like revenues at stores had led to five straight years of revenue growth and four out of five years of income growth. Even when Buffett bought companies for cheaper prices compared to their earnings, this consistent growth was often still present. For example, the
Washington Post
had grown revenues ten out of ten years and operating income eight out of ten years in the period before Buffett’s purchase. In almost all instances over this middle period of his career, Buffett invested in companies that could consistently deliver an ROTCE of above 20 percent after tax. Investing in companies that had consistent growth and high ROTCE meant that Buffett was indeed investing in compounders—ones with a long track record of consistent growth to depend on.
Just as his quantitative evaluation of businesses evolved, Buffett came to place even greater trust in his ability to understand the qualitative aspects of business operations. With his investment in American Express and later in GEICO, he risked a large portion of his portfolio based on key qualitative insights that others, and the market at large, were not able to see. In the case of American Express, he understood that the Salad Oil Scandal would not have a long-term effect on the company’s ability to generate profits, and he realized that other parts of the business (such the new credit card division) would position it to grow significantly in the future. When it came to GEICO, he recognized that the business had inherent competitive advantages in insurance and that a turnaround was likely.
The
Buffalo Evening News
was another investment driven by Buffett’s qualitative insights. Buffett purchased that business based not primarily on its historical earnings (which would have made the valuation seem very excessive), but on his deep knowledge of what the business could fundamentally become—one with a much higher margin and higher return, with very sticky revenues and pricing power. He understood this in part because of his experience in media, mentoring Katherine Graham at the
Washington Post
and Tom Murphy at Capital Cities. This investment would in a few short years validate Buffett’s trust in his own qualitative insights, as profits increased more than tenfold a few years after his purchase.
Finally, in these middle years, Buffett did not just shift his focus to higher-quality businesses, but also built increasing expertise in several business areas that he would come to revisit time after time—notably, insurance, media, and retail brands. While he did invest in companies in other industries, Buffett built an extremely strong understanding of business frameworks in these particular areas. He developed, for example, a keen sense of how to evaluate the underwriting of insurers by looking at loss, expense, and combined ratios, and assessing the kinds of risks management teams were taking. On the investment side, Buffett had clear perspectives about how to determine an insurer’s competency managing float.
Buffett’s expertise within these industries was not limited to the conceptual; he also built a network of resourceful people, including many CEOs. Within media, for instance, his close relationships with associates like Katharine Graham and Stan Lipsey were clearly instrumental in helping Buffett find and evaluate investment opportunities. His trust in management continued to play a central role in his investment decisions, but during these middle years he started to focus not only on their trustworthiness and operational ability, but also on their competence in allocating capital wisely. In certain instances like with Katharine Graham at the
Washington Post
, Buffett himself provided guidance on how to be conservative with making acquisitions and capital expenditures.
In the late years of Buffett’s career, since 1990, his challenge has been to invest ever-growing amounts of capital for Berkshire Hathaway. An obvious resulting change in his investment strategy has been the much greater emphasis on large companies. But in terms of his investment style, Buffett still seemed to maintain the qualitative focus that he honed during the middle years. Whether it was correctly assessing the mortgage crisis faced by Wells Fargo or his own admitted failure to understand the competitive dynamics faced by US Air, Buffett’s primary concern is his ability to understand fundamental insights better than other investors. In the service of this aim, he has gone back to the same industries—and at times, even the same companies—that he became expert in decades earlier.
Take, for example, General Re. By the time of Buffett’s investment, Berkshire already had a significant insurance operation of its own and was owner of insurance companies like GEICO, and Buffett knew the General Re owners. This experience gave him an understanding of the business that surpassed most other analysts. This knowledge was not lost on General Re’s management. As the story goes, when Buffett first met with them to discuss his purchase of the company, he said: “I’m strictly hands-off. You guys run your own business. I won’t interfere.” But when he subsequently started speaking about GEICO and quoting numbers, the team was amazed, and the chief underwriter Tad Montross exclaimed, in so many words: “Holy cow! This is hands off?”

Buffett stuck to his circle of competence, but his competence in those areas was always impressive and often beyond what he admitted to.
Even though Buffett followed the same overall investment philosophy and continued to add to his vast expertise in certain industries, working with huge amounts of capital forced him to evolve aspects of his strategy. Foremost, Buffett started to seek investments in companies that were not only very large and often more mature, but also where large amounts of capital could be intelligently deployed. Some of Buffett’s most recent investments, like MidAmerican Energy and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, exemplify this new approach.
MidAmerican Energy, as discussed earlier in the book, was primarily involved in building and efficiently operating several dozen power plants in the United States and around the world. The infrastructure required billions of dollars to build and maintain. When Buffett invested in the business in 1998, MidAmerican Energy had property, plant, and equipment of $4.2 billion on its books, which represented 166 percent of its revenues of that year. Because of the heavy capital requirements of the business, its after-tax returns, while relatively stable, were modest—usually in the high-single or low-double digits. The clear value for Buffett was that he could deploy large amounts of capital organically and at reasonable rates of return. This value was further enhanced through the unique structure Buffett used in investing in the company, which involved several different share classes and made some of the return more or less guaranteed.
Similarly, in the case of the railroad business Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the requirements for capital were immense. Along with laying and maintaining tracks, the company was faced with continual upkeep on locomotives, freight cars, and support facilities like yards, terminals, and dispatching centers. While the marginal return on capital of railroads was higher than the return based on the total capital employed, this was still a business that required billions of dollars of investments over a few years. As with MidAmerican Energy, for BNSF Buffett paid a price to earnings multiple above 15 times—hardly the dirt cheap price of some of his early investments. Instead, the key investment case for these two businesses—both of which Berkshire would soon own 100 percent—was that they required a large amount of invested capital and produced reasonable returns.
Further evidence of Buffett’s focus on deploying large amounts of capital is the structuring of investments as preferred or convertible shares with a fixed-income characteristic. This was the case with the US Air investment (covered in this book) as well as with Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Bank of America, and Burger King (not covered in this book). Buffett, during these late years, seems willing to accept slightly lower returns for being able to deploy large amounts of capital.
All in all, what I find most astounding is that Buffett’s investments were not limited to only cheap stocks or businesses with a high return on capital, nor were they limited specific aspects (like growth) or deep value. Buffett’s career evolved steadily, driven partly by the opportunities that were present in the market, partly by Buffett’s own development, and partly by the resources and limitations of the assets he managed. Some investment criteria, such as a trustworthy and capable management team, remained constant throughout his career. Other aspects, such as consistent growth and the ability of a company to compound or the necessity of a company for large amounts of capital, developed over time. This evolution allowed Buffett to maneuver from successfully managing a private investment partnership to successfully managing one of the largest investment vehicles in the world.
