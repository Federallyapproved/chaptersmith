1976: GEICO (Government Employees Insurance Company)
Warren Buffett’s investment in the automotive insurer GEICO spans several decades and includes many twists and turns. He learned of GEICO during his time at Columbia Business School when his professor and mentor, Benjamin Graham, sat on the board of the company. Buffett began researching GEICO out of curiosity, leading to the much-cited anecdote of a young Buffett visiting GEICO’s headquarters on a Saturday morning when the premises were empty except for a janitor and an investment officer named Lorimer Davidson. Davidson later became CEO, and Buffett eventually became owner of the entire company.
Buffett first invested in GEICO immediately after this memorable visit, quickly recognizing the strength of its business model. Unlike its contemporaries, GEICO sold directly to customers rather than through insurance agents—so instead of incurring the usual 30 percent of revenues in underwriting costs, its costs were only about 13 percent of revenues. GEICO was able to pass some of this savings on to its customers in the form of cheaper insurance prices. Moreover, GEICO, which stands for Government Employees Insurance Company, catered to a select customer base that was, on average, lower risk. In 1951 GEICO was trading at $42 per share, or roughly eight times its recent earnings. Noting the high level of growth, the competitive costs, and the superior customer base, Buffett—still a student—put three-quarters of his money in this one investment. He sold this stake a year later for a 50 percent profit.

2005 Annual Report
, 24.
In the
Commercial and Financial Chronicle
dated December 6, 1951, Buffett wrote a brokerage note speaking of GEICO as “The Security I Like Best.” The note—reprinted in the 2005 Berkshire Hathaway annual report—demonstrates that even at just 21 years of age, Buffett already understood many keys to successful investment research. He did not look at GEICO by itself, but calibrated it with the development of the overall car insurance sector it was operating in. He also looked deeply at specific operating metrics of GEICO. Realizing that the high growth many insurance companies claimed was merely a function of increasing prices due to inflation, Buffett broke out the growth in policyholders from the growth due to higher prices, thereby legitimizing GEICO’s true growth;

GEICO had increased policyholders from approximately 26,000 in 1940 to 144,000 in 1950.
In 1976 Buffett returned his attention to GEICO. While it had grown significantly during the 1950s and 1960s, expanding its customer base and its pricing model, by 1976 it was in serious trouble. CEO Norm Gidden’s focus on growth had led to years of poor underwriting decisions, and claims costs were spiraling out of control. By mid-1976, GEICO was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the share price had dropped to $2 per share from as high as $61 several years earlier. Strapped for cash, the company cut its dividend and desperately needed an injection of cash to continue as a business. As the situation worsened, Gidden was fired, and Sam Butler, a lawyer from Cravath, Swain, & Moore who at the time was the chairman of the board, took over as temporary CEO.

To most potential investors at the time, the situation would have seemed to be in free fall. At the annual shareholders meeting that year at the Washington Statler Hilton, a mob of angry investors grilled and booed management.
4
Clearly, Buffett had a different take on GEICO than the multitude of investors who had given up on the company. As the financials of GEICO reveal, the company indeed had some positives. Buffett knew from his prior experience (and as he recounted frequently in hindsight) that GEICO still had a unique position in the insurance industry. It insured a safe set of public employees and other low-risk customers and had built a good reputation within this market segment over the years. Also, unlike most of its larger peers, it sold its insurance directly instead of through agents, and its significant savings on distribution costs gave it a structural cost advantage. Based on this, the business had consistently grown policy numbers and underwriting profit in the 1950s and 1960s.
But there were many negatives. The business reported a loss of $190 million in underwriting for the year 1975, and—as Buffett attested—it was clear that the business was far underreserved for claims.
5
With $25 million in book capital, it would not have taken much to put the business’s survival at risk. The negatives of GEICO in 1976 are not often discussed now, but these would have seemed very significant to a potential investor at the time. First, an insurance business with a $190 million underwriting loss and only $25 million in equity capital was almost certainly in breach of regulatory capital requirements. It was no surprise that insurance commissioners from numerous states, including Washington, D.C.’s Max Wallach, were poised to declare GEICO bankrupt.
6
The risk that GEICO would be forced to stop operating was very real.
Moreover, a potential investor would have found it impossible to determine the actual scope of underreserving. The very nature of automotive insurance is that losses can be incurred many years into the future—for example, an injured individual who requires lifelong care. Hence, once an insurer is known to have set incorrectly low reserves, the extent of its error is very difficult to pinpoint. Much of the security of the business depends on the trust that management has been conservative, and once that trust is breached, it is very difficult to find footing. Considering these obvious negatives, GEICO would have been a heavy lift for any potential investor.
GEICO’s luck began to turn in May 1976, when Jack Byrne, a self-made insurance prodigy who had turned around Travelers Group, was recruited and appointed CEO, replacing the temporarily appointed Butler. Byrne, who had been disgruntled at having been passed over for the job of CEO at Travelers, would soon show his brilliance as an insurance executive. Indeed, he was a major reason for Buffett’s renewed interest in the company.
While Buffett understood that there were similarities to the American Express situation, GEICO, unlike American Express, was not strong enough to recover without help. What he needed to know, then, was whether there was management in place that would be able to pull off the turnaround and if the issues relating to having enough capital—both to satisfy regulatory requirements and to correct the issue of underreserving—could be resolved. On management, Buffett needed to know Jack Byrne. On capital, he had to understand the regulatory mandates for additional capital, how those could be met, and whether other insurance companies or banks would be willing to provide additional capital.
To assess Jack Byrne, Buffett scheduled a meeting through Katherine Graham and Lorimer Davidson. The key question “was whether Byrne really was cool, unflappable, and professional…a leader and a promoter…[able] to solve [GEICO’s] problem…[and] make that sale to all the constituencies.”
7
The meeting was more than reassuring. Buffett was so impressed with Byrne that he started purchasing shares the very next morning.
8
Buffett later said that he believed in Jack and thought he was the right man in every way to get GEICO back on track.
As far as the need for capital, Buffett knew he would be able to play a role. He went to see Wallach, the D.C. insurance regulator, and personally negotiated the deadlines and the stringency of the regulatory capital requirements set for GEICO. Moreover, Buffett significantly increased his own investment in the company, thereby giving a vote of confidence from a well-respected investor at this critical juncture. Although it was still an extremely difficult time to raise capital, Salomon Inc. (and specifically John Gutfreund, the influential executive at Salomon) ultimately agreed to underwrite a $76 million convertible stock offering for the company. Other reinsurance companies soon came forward to provide reinsurance, and the stock that had traded at $2 per share jumped to $8 per share.
Valuation
There were approximately 26.6 million shares of GEICO outstanding. The $190 million net loss in 1975 represented a loss of $7.14 per share. In this $7.14, investment income had been roughly $1 per share, while underwriting loss was roughly minus $8 per share. The combined ratio (when including reserve additions) on the roughly $900 million premiums written would have been an abysmal 124 percent. Although any valuation multiples based on these negative earnings would be nonsensible (the historical PER and EV/EBIT multiples for GEICO were negative), what Buffett likely calculated was what would happen if Jack Bryne was able to stop the bleeding and save some of the GEICO business. One can use a back-of-the-envelope scenario to estimate this: The scope of GEICO’s business is cut in half—written premiums go from $900 million to $450 million—but the combined ratio becomes 95 percent, a respectable but not unreasonable level. In this case, the underwriting loss would become an underwriting profit of approximately $22.5 million—a bit less than $1 per share in underwriting earnings. Assuming that, on average, half of a year’s premium would be held as float to be invested at the prevailing interest rate of around seven percent,
9
one would expect a further investment income of a bit more than $0.50 per share. In this scenario, the steady-state earnings of GEICO before tax would be around $1.50, with an after-tax figure of around $0.75 (the prevailing corporate rate was 48 percent). If one assumes that a fair PER multiple for this business would be 10×, the fair value of GEICO under this scenario would be $7.50 per share. Of course if the investor of the
float
were to get more than seven percent per annum (i.e., if Buffett were to get a return of 20 percent per annum), the business would have been worth much more than $7.50 per share. Likewise, if the premiums written did not stay at the reduced $450 million level but were able to grow again under Bryne’s leadership, the business would also have been worth significantly more.
10
Whatever the calculations here, Buffett clearly saw an opportunity. He paid $3.18 per share for the 1.3 million shares of GEICO common equity he bought in 1976.
11
At that price, even under the assumption of GEICO’s business being cut in half, Buffett would, incredibly, have had a
margin of safety
of over 50 percent. Buffett clearly did believe in Jack Bryne and GEICO’s inherent business quality, but he was also buying the business dirt cheap—cheap enough to compensate for what potential investors would have rightly seen as real business risks.
The rest of GEICO’s story was a fairy tale; Jack Byrne did everything right. He instituted proper underwriting standards and cut unprofitable business. A notable example of this is the story of Byrne walking into the office of James Sheeran, the New Jersey insurance commissioner, and—after unsuccessfully asking to raise rates in New Jersey—throwing GEICO’s state license on the table and firing two thousand New Jersey employees and terminating thirty thousand policyholders that very afternoon. GEICO quickly emerged as a leaner but also a healthier business. By 1977, GEICO returned to profitability. In the states it still operated in, GEICO was able raise its premiums by an average of 38 percent.
12
By 1979, GEICO made pretax profits of $220 million—an unimaginable figure just three years earlier.
With the turnaround going well, Buffett continued to accumulate shares of GEICO. In 1977, Berkshire owned 1,986,953 convertible preferred shares as well as 1,294,308 common shares of GEICO, then valued at $33.5 million. In 1979, the shareholder letter showed that Berkshire owned 5,730,114 shares in total. By 1980, GEICO had become the largest noncontrolled holding of Berkshire, representing 7.2 million shares. In 1981, over half of the gain in Berkshire’s net worth resulted from GEICO’s performance. By 1990 Berkshire owned 48 percent of the company.
In 1995 Berkshire’s investment went the
control
route when Buffett completed the purchase of 100 percent of the company, paying $2.3 billion for the approximately 50 percent that Berkshire did not own. While Buffett pointed out that Berkshire paid a steep price for the half of GEICO it did not own, the move was in line with his strategy of paying fair prices for good businesses. Buffett believed that GEICO still had the same structural advantages he first saw in 1951: selling directly, to better customers, at lower costs. As had been the case since Jack Byrne joined, GEICO was focused on building long-term relationships with its policyholders and benefiting from higher margins as the customer profile became more mature.
Overall, the investment case of GEICO was an amazing story spanning five decades. Buffett first invested in the company as a solid quality business selling at a reasonable valuation while he was still a student. In the 1970s, Buffett then bought the company as a turnaround situation where there were clear risks, but he was comfortable with an excellent manager in a business he still believed had a structural advantage in its industry. In the late years, GEICO then became a control situation. Buffett at this time paid a fair valuation for a business that continued to grow and perform operationally year after year. What ties the whole investment experience together is Buffett’s lifelong devotion to following a high-quality business over a truly impressive time period and acting when there was an opportunity.
