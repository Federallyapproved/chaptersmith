INTRODUCTION
Over the last thirty years, Warren Buffett and his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway have become household names. Likewise, Omaha, Nebraska is no longer an unknown midwestern town for anyone in the investment community. Buffett’s legendary investing performance has prompted small investors to want to invest just like him and many investment professionals seek to emulate his strategies. But what are Buffett’s greatest investments and in which context did he make them? Moreover, what can we learn from his experience?
The focus of this book is to uncover answers to these questions by journeying through Buffett’s investing career. Specifically, I look at the twenty investments Buffett made that I feel had the largest material impact on his trajectory. I selected a cross-section of different types of investments and investments I found especially informative. I also considered the relative size of each investment at the time it was made.
My approach in analyzing these key investments was to look at the detailed actions Buffett took when he made his investment decisions and try to understand from a third-party perspective what rationales he or any investor was likely to have seen in each situation. Where appropriate, I tried to take the perspective of an investment analyst studying the businesses at the same time in which Buffett did in order to highlight Buffett’s unique standpoint. In this way, unlike the many biographical books written about Buffett, this book focuses on telling the story of Buffett only as it relates to his key investments. This book aims to extend beyond the various publications that contain significant information about Buffett’s investments (including Buffett’s own annual letters) by leveraging original source documents and other historical information where possible. My overall aim is to give readers a realistic analysis of the key investments that Buffett made and then have them draw their own insights and conclusions.
The book consists of three sections, ordered chronologically. The first section details five key investments that Buffett made between 1957 and 1968 when he ran Buffett Partnership Limited, the private investment partnership he managed before taking over Berkshire Hathaway. The second section details nine investments Buffett made between 1968 and 1990, the first two decades when Berkshire Hathaway served as his investment vehicle. The third and final section focuses on the period at Berkshire since 1990. A brief introduction to each section provides a picture of how each investment fits within Buffett’s career as well as setting the broader investment context during that time period of the U.S. stock market, the primary market in which Buffett invested. Individual chapters in each section focus on the specific investments, treating each as a case study. The final section of the book reflects upon the broader evolution of Buffett as an investor. It also summarizes my overall learning from Buffett’s investment philosophy and strategy based on my analysis of his twenty key investments.
Before I consider the Buffett’s specific investments, I want to define the methodology I used in my analysis. In evaluating an investment, my approach was, first, to understand the qualitative factors and context of the investment and then its valuation. For the valuation, I accessed the intrinsic value based primarily on earnings that I considered the sustainable level of earnings for the company. Often this included adjustments made based on the cyclicality of a business. At times I adjusted for depreciation and amortization costs compared to maintenance capital expenditures (CAPEX), and at other times I simply used the last year’s earnings. For the sake of consistency and simplicity, I chose to stick with EV/EBIT

less frequently. In a few instances, where I felt it was warranted, I used an asset-based valuation instead of, or in addition to, the earnings-based valuation. The qualitative assessment and the valuation methodologies I have chosen are not the only ways to assess these companies. My analysis has a significant degree of interpretation, and certainly there are times when these interpretations could be improved by other adjustments that I did not make. In sum, however, this book aims to provide an accurate investment analysis of the companies based on the available data. Collectively, my analysis reflects my own best understanding and interpretation of Buffett’s investment decisions.

Part I
The Partnership Years (1957–1968)
Warren Buffett’s investment career started in earnest in 1957, with the formation of his first investment partnership. Following two years of working as a securities analyst at the Graham-Newman Corporation and the well-documented experience of studying at the Columbia Business School under Benjamin Graham, Buffett established Buffett Partnership Limited (BPL) with the funding of a few friends, family, and close associates.

While details of Buffett’s investment thought process are much more widely documented later in his career, a few obvious themes can be discerned in his partnership years. Foremost is the focus on being a buyer at a good price. In his 1962 partnership letter, Buffett states that the cornerstone of his investment philosophy is to purchase assets at a bargain price, which he considers in the traditional Benjamin Graham view of low price versus intrinsic valuation—a fundamental assessment of a company’s ability to generate cash flow or a company’s value in assets. Second, Buffett adopts a strong view of a moving market; Mr. Market either overvalues or undervalues a company, but over the long run does pass around the intrinsic value. Third, Buffett also pays attention to investor psychology as pertains to who is investing in the market and what impact this investor thinking has. Specifically, he mentions several times the concept of whether investors have steady hands and the manias of different periods.
In running his partnership, Buffett kept secret his holdings during this period and adopted a black-box type of strategy with his limited partners. In the appendix of his 1963 year-end partnership letter he states, “We cannot talk about our current investment operations. Such an open-mouth policy could never improve our results and in some situations could seriously hurt us. For this reason, should anyone, including partners, ask us whether we are interested in any security, we must plead the Fifth Amendment.”
The significant investments Buffett made during this time were a mix of value bets and corporate actions. At times BPL would invest up to 35 percent of its net assets into a single company and at times, given the opportunity, take a majority ownership stake in the company.
When Buffett ran his partnership during the late 1950s and 1960s, the United States was enjoying relatively calm and economically prosperous times: on the heels of the Korean War in the 1950s and in the midst of the Cold War at the beginning of the 1960s, the U.S. economy was less eventful than its politics. In the 1950s the Dow climbed from approximately 200 points in 1950 to roughly 600 points in 1960 (a 200 percent increase). Although there was a small recession at the beginning of the 1960s that saw the Dow pull back into the 530s in 1962 from a high in the 730s at the end of 1961 (a decrease of 27 percent), the Dow would rise again to over 900 by 1965 (a 70 percent increase from the low). The economy continued to grow through the Kennedy years, with signs of the first serious concerns only surfacing at the end of the 1960s when inflation rates started increasing ever more quickly. By the time Buffett closed his investment partnership in 1968, economic prosperity abounded to a level where he found it increasingly difficult to find the value investments that he was looking for. This was in fact one of the key rationales for ending his partnership amidst great performance.
The five investments discussed in part I of this book are the investments I deemed the most significant or otherwise most interesting during Buffett’s partnership years.
