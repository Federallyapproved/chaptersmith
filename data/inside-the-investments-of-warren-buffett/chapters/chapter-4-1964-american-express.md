1964: American Express
In a way, American Express seems to be as high tech of a company as Warren Buffett gets. In the early 1960s, American Express represented the new. As the U.S. population discovered air travel, payment by travelers cheque became an increasingly common trend. At this time American Express was also pioneering the first plastic credit card. The main advantage of both forms of paperless payment was that they were authentic and did not require transacting by cash. Cash simply did not make sense when dealing in large sums of money or when traveling internationally. When merchants or suppliers received an American Express travelers cheque, they knew that the check was trustworthy. The other alternative for large sums of money or international payments at the time was a letter of credit, but this was significantly more cumbersome as it involved paperwork with a bank. In this way, American Express pioneered a superior product, but more on this later.
In 1963, American Express suffered a catastrophe in what came to be known as the Salad Oil Swindle. In November of that year it was discovered that one of its subsidiaries, a warehouse in Bayonne, New Jersey, had written receipts, based upon which loans were made to a company called Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining. This company, as it later turned out, was committing fraud. Allied went bankrupt, and the warehouse, when collecting the collateral, realized that the tanks that it had thought were filled with valuable salad oil were instead filled with seawater. With an estimated liability of up to $150 million, Allied and the American Express subsidiary filed for bankruptcy protection. Whether American Express, the parent company, was liable was uncertain. Nevertheless, fearing damage to American Express’s reputation, CEO and President Howard Clark issued a statement that American Express felt morally bound to see that such liabilities were satisfied.

Figure 4.1.
The word on the street was that American Express could face insolvency. Its stock, which had been trading at $60 per share before the news, dropped to $35 per share by early 1964 amid much bad publicity.
2
One comment often made about American Express was that it faced “
unknown and potentially enormous liabilities.”
In addition to the bad publicity, American Express shareholders sued Howard Clark when he offered the creditors $60 million to settle claims, which the shareholders judged to be an unnecessary fulfillment of a moral obligation. In comparison to the book value of American Express at the time, which was $78 million, this seemed like a very large sum.
According to Lowenstein’s account, Buffett, sensing potential opportunity beneath the scandal, carefully began his primary research. He spoke to customers and vendors in Omaha, including restaurants and restaurant customers, to see if their using habits had changed. He also went to banks and travel agencies, and he even spoke to competitors. Everywhere he went, the conclusion he drew was that the use of American Express travelers cheques and credit cards seemed to be steady despite the scandal. He surmised that American Express would continue operating as is, that reputational damage was not likely to be permanent, and that the brand seemed very strong and synonymous with the product. He also concluded that the company was unlikely to go insolvent.

It is important to look at how an investor may have pictured American Express at the time. (See
tables 4.1
through
4.3
for a reproduction of several key pages of the 1963 American Express annual report, including the consolidated financial statements.

) As we can see, in the section titled the
Ten Year Financial Summary
, on pages four and five of the report, American Express publishes a full ten-year history of its income financials. We notice immediately how strong a business American Express was in the decade preceding 1963.
From 1954 to 1963, American Express’s revenues grew from $37 million to $100 million. Even more impressive, in no single year during this period did revenues decline from the previous year. The picture for income per share and total book value of the company mirrored that of the revenues; income per share grew from $1.05 to $2.52, and book value increased from $42 million to $79 million. Hence on a per annum (p.a.) compounded basis, revenues increased 12 percent p.a., and net earnings increased 10 percent p.a. in the previous nine years.
During the year ending December 31, 1963, American Express delivered net earnings of exactly $11.2 million ($2.52 per share for each of the 4.46 million shares outstanding) on revenues of $100.4 million. The profit before tax (it reported “income before United States and foreign income taxes”) was at $16.0 million. With a simple calculation, this translates to an operating margin of about 16 percent and a net profit margin of about 11 percent, both metrics, suggesting nice profitability.

At first glance, based on just the financial numbers, American Express looked like it was running well on all cylinders and had been doing so for quite some time. To really understand a business, however, and to determine whether it is truly a quality business, one must look at more than just financials. To understand American Express’s business and how it delivered such good financial results year after year, it is important to analyze the operating segments of the company and the competitive environment in which these sub-businesses were operating.
In its 1963 annual report, American Express discusses its operating segments in a fair level of detail. In total, the report details ten separate businesses. Unfortunately, American Express at the time did not break down the size and margins of each business areas. Still, from the order and depth of the discussion, one can clearly infer which businesses are the core businesses, and which the secondary businesses. From largest to smallest in scale, the businesses included travelers cheques, money orders, utility bills, travel, credit cards, commercial banking, foreign remittances, freight, Wells Fargo, Hertz, and warehousing.
Before I discuss the workings of the major businesses, it should be noted that with ten separate operating segments, American Express was not a simple business in the traditional sense of one business involved in one clear activity. Nevertheless, if we anlayze each business individually, we can be reassured that an inquisitive investor should understand both businesses because they are based on business models and people rather than complex technology.
The largest business, which is also discussed first in the report, was the travelers cheque business. American Express sold paper checks that customers who are to travel abroad could purchase at numerous locations before departure, and which would subsequently be accepted at both venues and banks abroad. These venues and banks would then exchange these checks for foreign currency. American Express collected cash and a small fee from customers, while in turn providing them with a network of international banks and venues where their finances would be accepted without question. To encourage more international merchants to accept this product, American Express paid a small commission to the merchants for accepting their travelers cheques.
At the time, the main alternative to American Express travelers cheques was a letter of credit from a bank. A customer, the same international traveler for example, would go to a bank and, using a combination of deposits, collateral, or previous relationship, would ask the bank to issue a letter of credit. The customer would then present this letter of credit to a foreign bank, which would either provide the customer with foreign currency or otherwise enable the customer to make payments while abroad.
The travelers cheque has several key advantages over the letter of credit. First, while travelers cheques were very simple to purchase at any American Express affiliate, the process of getting a letter of credit depended on the specific issuing bank and usually involved significant paperwork and took several days. Because it was less complex, American Express’s solution usually also entailed fewer transaction costs. Compared to cash, travelers cheques could be easily replaced when stolen and hence offered an additional protection for travelers.
Moreover, the benefits of travelers cheques were not just for its customers. According to American Express, issuing banks saw selling travelers cheques as a way to bring in new customers to cross-sell other products. In doing so, the banks took a small fee and lessened their burden of doing letter-of-credit work for smaller sums, which likely was a side business. For receiving banks, i.e., the banks that accepted a letter of credit or that cashed travelers cheques, there was also an important advantage of standardization. Because letters of credit were guaranteed by the issuing bank, the receiving bank had to individually assess the credit worthiness of the issuing institution. In contrast, American Express travelers cheques were always guaranteed by American Express, an institution that by this time had become well-known internationally. As a result, it was much easier to cash a travelers cheque than receive payment under the terms of a letter of credit.
While the advantages of travelers cheques were easy to understand, what quantitative evidence was there to support this? Looking specifically at American Express’s ten-year financial summary in
table 4.1
, we can see that outstanding travelers cheques had increased to $470 million in 1963 from $260 million in 1954. Calculated on an annualized rate, outstanding travelers cheques had increased seven percent per annum over the previous ten years.
This information, along with the positive qualitative details given by American Express President and CEO, Howard Clark, in his annual report,
5
should have shown investors that the travelers cheque business was in the midst of a multi-year (in fact multi-decade) trend of replacing letters of credit for a significant part of that market. American Express, the market leader for travelers cheques, would be the main beneficiary of this development. In sum, then, American Express’s travelers cheque business seemed like a wonderful business that was growing and had significant advantages over its peers.
The second business that is discussed in American Express’s annual report is the money orders and utility bills business. The business had its roots in the 1880s, when to counter the U.S. Postal Service’s introduction of money orders, American Express developed its own competing product. The purpose of the product was very simple: the safe delivery via courier or mail service of money. By 1963, the American Express money order was the largest selling commercial instrument of its kind in the United States. It was the only commercial money order to be sold in all fifty states.
6
Although by this time it was also a stagnant business, the business itself was on solid footing, providing a useful service for customers and functioning as a complement to travelers cheques.
The third business of American Express was its travel business. Selling steamship cruise tickets and organizing international travel excursions, the travel component of American Express was a business that had many local and international competitors, both large and small. As such, this seemed to be an execution business, with few barriers to entry. Here, results were mixed year by year, and success simply meant better execution than peers with moderate returns. The discussion of the 1963 annual report on this business indicates that 1963 marked a second year of reorganization in this business where establishing a more decentralized business model and a more prominent focus on better customer service would result in greater effectiveness.
The fourth business discussed, the credit card business, was an important driver of new growth by 1963, even though it was not yet a huge business at this time. Although first pioneered in the 1910s by Western Union and commercialized in its current form in the 1950s by Diners Club, American Express quickly became a leader in this segment with its strong network and brand. The first American Express credit card was launched jointly with Bank of America and the BankAmericard in 1958. Despite remarkable growth in customer uptake, operational troubles hampered this division’s early profitability, but by 1963 this business had been profitable for two years.
7
In its 1963 annual report, American Express reports total card membership increasing to over one million members for the first time.
As shown in
figures 4.2
and
4.3
, annual credit billings were growing even faster.

Based on a business model that charged both merchants (a percentage commission) as well as cardholders (an annual fee), the American Express credit card division had a sensible way to monetize its services. Moreover, given that the business model revolved around having a network of cardholders and merchants accepting the card, American Express had a natural advantage with the strong reputation of the American Express brand, especially in travel and international business. The BankAmericard, initially targeted at businessmen and wealthy individuals as a travel and entertainment card, quickly became a hit. In addition to providing its customers with the “cool factor” of having a reputable charge card, the BankAmericard facilitated easy payment for travelers and conferred numerous additional benefits such as travel insurance, which soon became a signature service for American Express cards. Merchants were willing to pay a commission for the opportunity to attract affluent customers who used the American Express credit card. Hence, there was clear customer value for both sides of the transaction.
If one considers this value and the absence of strong competitors, the value was likely significantly greater than what American Express was charging at the time, at least with respect to merchants. This would suggest some hidden pricing power. Because any competition would have to build a competing network as extensive as that of American Express to make it as valuable for cardholders and merchants, American Express had the clear advantage. All in all, investors would have seen very attractive prospects in this business in 1963.
Admittedly, it would have been difficult to foresee the development of MasterCard and Visa several decades later. The astute observer may have surmised that, unlike some of the safest products driven by network economics, in the case of the credit card, the cost for users was low enough that it did not preclude a user from having multiple cards.
The next five businesses for American Express were banking, foreign remittances, freight, Wells Fargo, and Hertz. I will discuss their key economics jointly as a group because they are smaller businesses that share some similarities.
Commercial banking as a business was not too different from a regular retail bank, taking deposits and making loans. The difference for American Express was that it had significant numbers of international branches, including branches on military bases. Foreign remittances provided commercial firms and individuals a safe and easy way of transferring funds across countries. The freight business was a freight forwarding and customs business similar to the freight forwarding businesses that operates currently in the United States. The next two businesses were Wells Fargo and Hertz. The former business was involved in transporting cash and valuables, much like today’s armored transport businesses. The latter was a joint venture with the Hertz Corporation and a rental company for cars and trucks operating outside of the United States. American Express had a 49 percent stake in Hertz. Interestingly, both are familiar names today. In fact, Wells Fargo, the famous bank, was started by the founders of American Express, Henry Wells and William Fargo. Hertz, of course, remains one of the largest rental car companies in the world.
Still, looking at this group of five businesses, we must conclude that while obviously complementary to the main American Express businesses, they do not look like businesses where American Express would likely have had a particular competitive advantage over other established players of the time.
The last American Express business was its field warehousing business (the one hit by the salad oil scandal). The main activity of this unit was to provide authenticity receipts for inventory and other assets of customers so that these customers could use these assets for collateral in obtaining loans from banks and other financial institutions. The traditional business model for warehousing receipts involved public warehouses. In this business model a customer delivers its inventory into a public storage facility where it is held and monitored by a custodian. For products that require aging, such as tobacco and liquor, it is not unusual that they are financed and stored in public warehouses. However, in some cases it is not practical to transport inventory, such as when that inventory is bulky or difficult to transport. In such a scenario, a field warehouse may be established on the customer’s or the borrower’s grounds. In this field warehousing business that American Express was involved in, the field warehousing company would have had inspectors who established a control and supervision of inventory at the warehouse owned by the customer or borrower.
In the case of the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Company, American Express had a touring inspector who monitored the inventory at Allied’s Bayone, New Jersey storage tanks. American Express had hired some of Allied’s own men as custodians. In this instance, the American Express’s touring inspector did not take full physical inventory.
I will discuss the specific scandal and the nature and extent of issues later, but in terms of the overall business, the field warehousing business seems to have been a fairly simple, capital-light business where a company with a great reputation, such as American Express, would likely have an advantage over peers. The key risks here would involve the detailed legal terms of any contractual commitments that were made by American Express, specifically whether or not it would guarantee all collateral for which it had issued receipts.
Overall, American Express seemed like a great business with significant structural advantages in its core businesses. While some of the smaller business divisions like travel, Wells Fargo, and freight seem to have few fundamental advantages over peers, the most significant businesses, including the travelers cheque and the credit card businesses, were wonderful franchise-quality businesses that boasted long-term, sustainable growth.
To support this conclusion, we will take one more look at the income statement and balance sheets reported by American Express, shown in
tables 4.2
and
4.3
. The data in these tables suggest two additional insights that support this assessment.

In summary, we see several significant data points on the American Express balance sheet at the end of 1963. On the asset side, there are $267 million in cash and $444 million in investment securities (the vast majority of this sum was in U.S. government and state and municipal bonds), $35 million in U.S. government bonds (presumably held in custody for clients as there is a matching contra account in liabilities), $172 million in loans, $52 million in accounts receivables, and $14 million for PPE (reported as “Land, buildings and equipment—reported at cost”). Together, assets totaled $1.02 billion. On the liabilities side, there are outstanding travelers cheques of $470 million, customer deposits of $366 million, the contra liability for U.S. government bonds of $35 million matching that on the asset side, and several other smaller liabilities. Liabilities totaled $942 million. The resulting total shareholders’ equity was $78 million.
First, one insight that can be derived from the balance sheet is that, in a way, American Express was very similar to a bank or an insurance company. With a business that inherently generates assets in the form of cash and investable securities as well as liabilities in the form of outstanding travelers cheques, American Express was creating a situation similar to the float of insurance companies (even when not considering the banking operations that it owned). This is reflected in the fact that, in 1963, American Express carried a total balance sheet more than ten times greater than its shareholders’ equity. In fact, when the customer deposits and outstanding travelers cheques are tallied, American Express is effectively holding $837 million in value, which belongs to its customers. Like banks and insurance companies, it gains income from investing these assets into bonds, stocks, and loans.
Second, looking at the return on capital employed by the business, we see that American Express as a whole is very light on physical capital. When using the usual preferred metric of return on capital employed by dividing owner earnings
8
by capital employed
9
we can make a rough calculation. With only $14 million in land, buildings, and equipment, and a net working capital base that is effectively negative if one considers the float characteristics of having customer deposits and outstanding travelers cheques, the return on capital employed (ROCE) would be about 78 percent if we assume a net working capital of zero. If one fully considers the negative working capital, the total capital employed would be negative and the ROCE infinite. Net earnings for the year were $11.2 million. Note that net earnings is used in the calculation rather than the preferred metric of owner earnings because, without cash-flow statements at this time, owner earnings could not be meaningfully calculated. In any case, a 78 percent (or even higher) ROCE for normal businesses would be indicative of a very significant franchise value, which enables the business to generate returns far in excess of its cost of capital. It also means that the business has to reinvest very little additional capital to grow the business, which is beneficial because that cash can be used to pay shareholders or for acquisitions.
Howard Clark’s letter to shareholders appears to support this view. In this letter, Clark explains that “in the four years ending December 31, 1963, with virtually no increase in the number of employees consolidated operating revenues have increased by almost 50%, pre-tax income from operations over 100%, and post-tax earnings from operations about 60%.”
The astute investor may take issue with the use of the normal ROCE as a measure for performance of the business given the significant financial leverage inherent in the business. This concern is justified. If we look at financial performance based on return on equity (ROE), the more typical metric for financial firms, we arrive at a ROE of over 14 percent, which, while less impressive, is still significantly higher than the cost of capital and would also indicate a superior business.
Before I move on to the valuation of American Express, one other item that should be discussed—in any investment case—is the management. Here, what was known of Howard Clark, CEO and president of American Express, was that he joined American Express in 1960, three years prior to the time in question. Operationally, the two major efforts he had undertaken at American Express were fixing the credit card business and driving marketing efforts.
When Clark joined American Express the credit card division was losing money mainly because it had been overwhelmed in the back-office transaction processing of payments generated by the credit cards, which were quickly growing in number. Clark instituted immediate measures to lighten the burden on American Express, including introducing a requirement for cardholders to repay all debt within thirty days, establishing stricter guidelines for credit approval, and increasing fees for merchants and cardholders. On the marketing side, Clark increased the advertising budget annually, and he hired advertising agency Ogilvy, Benson, & Mather to develop American Express’s first modern advertising campaign. Overall, Clark seemed a competent and decisive force when it came to fixing American Express’s operational issues.
10
In addition to addressing operational issues, Clark also promised to address the salad oil scandal, even though liability of the American Express parent company had not been established. In this sense, Clark appears to have been an individual of utmost personal integrity, a fact that Buffett surely respected.
Now that we have a fair idea of the business of American Express and who was running it, we turn to the purchase valuation that Buffett paid. Although Buffett does not give explicit details about his American Express purchase in his year-end 1964 partnership letter, American Express dropped to a price of around $35 per share during the time Buffett was making the purchase. If we then assume that Buffett bought his shares at an average price of $40 per share, as his purchase was significant and unlikely to have been made at a rock-bottom price, his purchase price would have looked like the following (at least at first glance). With 4.46 million shares outstanding, he would have valued American Express at a price-earnings multiple of 16× based on fiscal year 1963 net earnings of $11 million. On a trailing year EV/EBIT basis, Buffett would have paid a multiple of 8×, if we consider the cash and financial investments of American Express as well as its financial liabilities in its net financial debt calculation. Although one could argue against the true value of the investment assets, I believe that the aforementioned calculation is a conservative estimate because the investment assets were recorded at cost. If one is even more conservative and considers the net cash value of the company to be zero, the resulting EV/EBIT multiple would be 11×.
By Buffett’s standards, this is not a cheap price by any means, even though the business had sold for what would have been a 24× price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) before the turmoil. This is somewhat perplexing. While acknowledging the superior quality of American Express, this is still a valuation that seems just a bit too high based on Buffett’s usual criteria, and even more so because the liability that the company faced due to the Salad Oil Scandal was still unknown. The valuation remains key to understanding the purchase. Either Buffett was indeed willing to pay a high price for an outstanding business, or the valuation was not as high as it appears.
First, we must understand the liability of the scandal. The most detailed account of this liability comes from the management of American Express, who spends two pages of the 1963 annual report discussing this issue. Assuming one can believe management (who genuinely seems open about issues and trustworthy), the liability appears somewhat tenuous and capped at a bit under $100 million, significantly lower than the market estimates of $150 million. In the report, the company states that the amount of soybean oil for which American Express had written verification receipts totaled $82 million (this does not consider the worth of the high-quality seawater in the containers, which in fact also had some market value). In addition to this, another $15 million in delivery orders was being disputed. One-third of the $39 million of receipts for additional sunflower oil were found to be forged, so it appeared likely that American Express would not have any liability for this amount. While it is impossible to determine the extent of the final liabilities, based on the information it appears to have been between $20 and $80 million, with the high end reflective of management taking the moral high road and offering to pay for almost all liabilities that could be interpreted as American Express’s mistake (this was management’s plan, as stated in the annual report). To put a rough figure on this, the real expected liability would be $60 million minus a potential tax shelter of $20 million (simply based on reduced earnings at a 34 percent corporate tax rate), or a net cash liability of $40 million.
If we look at the balance sheet, the intrinsic business of American Express generated so much gross cash that the company would certainly have had the cash to cover the liability (at the time, American Express had increased cash to over $250 million). It seems that the only way that they would have been unable to pay for this liabilities is if their customers stopped using their services. In this sense, it appears that Howard Clark’s focus on maintaining the integrity of the company’s reputation, even if it meant paying some unnecessary liabilitie, was justified. In terms of the impact on valuation, however, a $40 million cost would mean that for a $40 per share price investors would be purchasing the business for an even higher multiple, roughly 20× P/E and 11× EV/EBIT.
These are prices that Buffett almost certainly would not pay. So where is the missing link? After some further consideration, it seems that the operating earnings of American Express only tell part of the story. One key similarity American Express appeared to share with insurance companies was that the investment earnings arising from the float do not show up in the operating earnings. In fact, the float arising from travelers cheques seems to be one where American Express did not have to explicitly pay interest. In any case, if we look carefully at the comprehensive earnings in 1963,

it is clear that in addition to the $11 million in operating net earnings, American Express also earned a further $4.4 million after tax in additional realized investment gains, which are credited directly to share shareholders’ equity. This in fact had caused shareholders’ equity to increase by about $10 million, even though dividend payments in that year had totaled $6.4 million. This sum is in addition to approximately $1.0 million of returns on investments, which are reported within the $11 million total operating net income.
While $4.4 million in 1963 may be an unrepresentative extraordinary gain, directionally there should at least be more of this type of investment returns resulting from the float. If we assume that on average travelers cheques are outstanding for two months, and then take the 1963 year-end sum of outstanding travelers cheques of $470 million, one would expect a running float from travelers cheques of about $80 million. If one assumes a five percent return on assets, one would expect about $4 million to be generated from this float per annum. While this is a purely hypothetical example, and the portion of float that comes from the travelers cheque business, the credit card business (negative float), and the bank cannot be determined exactly, I suspect that, on the whole, the true intrinsic earnings power of the travelers cheque float was significant and additional to operating earnings.
If we were to take the $4.4 million after-tax additional income in 1963 as an example, an adjusted earnings, including both investment and operating earnings, would value American Express stock of $40 per share at a P/E multiple of 11.5× and an EV/EBIT of 6.5×. Adjusted for the scandal liability of $40 million, there is an adjusted P/E figure of 14.2× and an EV/EBIT of 8.5×. This seems much more reasonable in terms of valuation, and something that does make sense given the very good quality of the business.
In addition to the float, another argument that could be made was that the American Express credit card business, which fundamentally was a good quality business, was just recovering from operational issues. As previously mentioned, 1963 was only the second year of its profitability. Thus, one could assert that 1963 earnings were still understated given the hidden earnings power in the credit card business, which was surely just starting to be realized.
In the end, American Express was not a cheap purchase. It seems that Buffett focused on finding a truly great business with a structural competitive advantage and investing at a price that can be considered reasonable given the total picture. To get to this point, Buffett seemed to have benefited from his understanding of float as well as his understanding of how the structural advantages that American Express had in its core businesses would allow it to grow with high returns with limited additional capital. Buffett also conducted primary research that helped him assess if the scandal affected the core of the business. Here we should point out that the scandal involved an extraordinary liability in a small subsidiary of American Express that did not itself affect the core operations of the business.
Unlike Buffett’s other early purchases, this was a cigar-butt

type of investment. Perhaps it was the subsequent success of this investment that helped inculcate Buffett’s later preference for paying fair value for a really good business over paying a really good price for an average one.
