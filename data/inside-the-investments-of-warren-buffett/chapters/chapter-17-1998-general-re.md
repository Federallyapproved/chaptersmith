1998: General Re
On December 21, 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 100 percent of General Re Corporation for $22 billion, using both cash and stock. From a strategic viewpoint, the rationale for the acquisition was that Berkshire, a company with extremely strong cash generation from its operating businesses, was an ideal candidate to absorb the volatility involved in a large-scale reinsurance business.
1
The line of thinking went that Berkshire did not need to worry about short-term financial volatility in one business segment, and General Re would be able to write more business profitably after being acquired than as a standalone. Berkshire also would have access to General Re’s capital to potentially better invest those assets. Lastly, Berkshire would gain additional expertise in insurance and a broader international distribution network.
Before jumping into the details of the acquisition, one must note the financial environment in which this acquisition took place. The stock market had been on a tear in the years immediately before 1998, with the S&P index generating more than 20 percent year over year in 1995, 1996, and 1997. It was on the way to doing so again in 1998. Mirroring the bull years in the general market, the insurance industry had also enjoyed a string of good years. As noted in Warren Buffett’s 1997 annual letter to clients, dated February 1998,

Berkshire’s insurance business had generated five consecutive years of profitable underwriting.
To delve into the investment case of General Re, one must start with its fundamentals. In the description of the business in its 1997 year-end report filing, General Re presents itself as a global business with four main divisions:

As
table 17.1
shows, General Re’s insurance business centered on reinsuring property and casualty risks, with the company’s most profitable segment in North America.
The report gives further detail on the North American property/casualty segment, stating that it was principally focused on direct underwriting of treaty and facultative reinsurance. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance that is set by a framework contract and that automatically covers all of a certain class of risks passed on by the primary insurer to the reinsurer. Facultative reinsurance involves the underwriting of individual risks through specific contracts. (There are two other kinds of reinsurance—pro rata reinsurance, which reinsures for a defined proportion of an overall risk by the reinsurer, and excess reinsurance, which describes the nonproportional risk assumed when a reinsurer insures a risk above a specified limit to be paid by the primary insurer.) In focusing on these two types of reinsurance, General Re assumed risks either written as framework contracts or as underwriting per individual risk. The percentage in this division between casualty and property was approximately 60 percent to 30 percent, with the remaining 10 percent falling under specialty lines.
The second division—international property/casualty reinsurance—was quite similar in nature to the first business, with 61 percent of this division’s gross written premium coming in property reinsurance and 39 percent coming in casualty reinsurance. The main difference is the international nature of this segment, which underwrote reinsurance in 150 countries. This international segment was the result of a 1994 acquisition of a controlling stake in Cologne Re based in Germany.
The third business division—global life/health reinsurance—was also partly a result of the Cologne Re acquisition and was also an international business, with 38 percent of premiums written in Europe, 47 percent of premiums written in North America, and the remainder in the rest of the world. Unlike the first two businesses, the main reinsuring in this division was based on individual and group life and health policies. Most of the life business was written on a proportional basis, while most of the health business was written on an excess (nonproportional) basis.
The last business—financial services—was a small business that provided numerous professional services like real estate brokerage and real estate management, as well as dealing in derivative and structured products. The derivative and structured products segment offered major corporations, insurance companies, and financial institutions customized offerings to manage risks.
Overall, as a potential investor, I would not have seen anything especially remarkable in the business setup. General Re was likely more exposed to certain kinds of risks as a result of its involvement in global casualty and property and some life and health insurance, but it would be difficult to judge its business quality without looking more closely at its financial metrics. In my experience with insurance businesses, the key judgment about the performance of a company comes down to whether the company is run conservatively and for profit, or for growth. In order to determine this, it is crucial to look at the numbers the company presents and the assumptions underpinning these numbers. Here, a bit more explanation is needed in order to take a closer look at how this information plays out in the case of General Re.
General Re’s annual report of 1997 provides a wonderfully detailed 11-year history of key financials, covering the years from 1987 to 1997. It shows that revenues increased from $3.1 billion in 1987 to $8.3 billion in 1997, representing a 10-year CAGR of 10.2 percent. Likewise, net income increased from $511 million to $968 million, albeit at a lesser CAGR of 6.6 percent. Note that for General Re, as with most insurance businesses, the bulk of revenues came in the form of earned premiums. Earned premium is revenue from customers as their time under a policy expires and is hence recognized over time (e.g., John Smith pays for a one-year auto insurance policy and seven months have expired—seven months’ revenue is recognized).
On the cost side, the first major cost comes from claims that are incurred and must be paid (e.g., John Smith subsequently requires auto repair for an accident). The total cost of claims is called the loss expense, and this figure as a percentage of total earned premiums is called the
loss ratio
. In addition to the cost of claims themselves, the insurance company also has costs associated with running the insurance business, such as selling and underwriting. This cost in sum, divided by the total earned premiums, is called the
expense ratio
. If one adds up the cost of claims and the cost of operations, one arrives at the total cost of underwriting. This total cost of underwriting divided by the total earned premiums is called the
combined ratio
. As a figure, the lower the combined ratio the better; it means either better underwriting decisions leading to fewer claims per earned amount or an efficiently run insurance operation with low operating expenses, or both.
In the lingo of insurance, a combined-ratio below 100 percent means that the earned premiums were sufficient to cover the total costs of underwriting. When the combined ratio is over 100, it means that it costs the insurance company more to pay for claims and other costs than it earned through premiums. The difference must then be made up by the investment income or other forms of earnings, or the company will suffer an overall loss.
3
In the insurance industry a combined ratio of 100 or below is considered good.
It may seem strange to say that achieving a total cost equivalent to total premium revenue is a “good performance.” However, insurance businesses almost always receive their premiums before they have to pay for claims. In some reinsurance businesses, where the risks underwritten are long term, there may be years between when a customer pays his or her premium and when a claim is made. Thus, an insurance company is able to hold cash that is essentially the customer’s. This amount, which appears on the balance sheet and is called
float
, is available for the insurance company to invest in order to generate investment income. As such, the total underwriting performance (revenue minus cost) is simply the cost of generating the float capital for the insurance company. If the company can generate an investment return superior to this total underwriting cost, it will be profitable as a firm. Hence, the bar of what is considered acceptable in terms of underwriting performance is lower than a combined ratio of 100 percent. A combined ratio of 100 percent means that the company is generating float for free. An insurance company does not have to perform that well to generate a positive return given that it is able to generate any investment return. As such, the industry as a whole usually operates at a combined ratio above 100 percent, with investment returns making up for a shortfall in underwriting performance.
Figure 17.1
shows a graph from a study conducted by Swiss Re on the overall underwriting performance for insurance companies between 1980 and 2000.

This graph presents the combined ratio of the overall nonlife insurance industry in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.
Figure 17.1.
As one can see, while the ratio varied with insurance cycles with peaks around 1984 and 1993 and troughs around 1988 and 1993, the long-term average combined ratio was significantly above 100 percent for the industry in each region.
So where does General Re’s performance fall? In its 1997 report, the company reported loss, expense, and combined ratios for its largest two divisions in the North American and international property/casualty divisions; I have summarized these in
table 17.2
.
Table 17.2.
Summary of operations
As one can see, on the whole, the underwriting performance of General Re in the North American property/casualty business was quite consistent, with an 11-year average combined ratio of 100.6 percent. This meant that the total underwriting costs were roughly equivalent to the net premiums—and further, that the underwriting performance of General Re was better than average.
Analyzing the breakdown of claims costs and operational costs in a bit more detail, one sees that over the 11-year period, General Re was able to bring down its loss ratio from 75 percent to 68 percent, but much of this improvement was negated by increased operational costs, which as a percentage of premiums written increased from 25 percent to 31 percent in that timeframe. Thus, while underwriting decisions had been good and improving in the North American business, operationally the business had grown a bit fatter. Buffett may have seen this as an area of possible improvement.
Regarding the international casualty/property division, General Re (which in this segment was mostly Cologne Re prior to 1994) had a more volatile performance with an average combined ratio over the period of 103 percent. There was a particularly weak period between 1990 and 1993, when the combined ratio averaged above 109 percent. Looking at the loss ratio and expense ratio separately, an investor at the time may have concluded that this was caused by a combination of less conservative underwriting and poor operational efficiency starting in 1990. Although operational efficiency as represented by the expense ratio was back down by 1997, the loss ratio of 72 percent in 1997 was still much higher than the loss ratios in the late 1980s. This loss could be the remnants of poor underwriting decisions or simply a result of a very favorable insurance environment in the late 1980s.
All in all, General Re, as captured by its two core casualty/property reinsurance divisions, seemed to be a decent but not an amazing reinsurance business. As a potential investor, I would have seen a slightly different story in the North American and international businesses, with the former improving in underwriting but not operational efficiency and the latter recovering from some poor years.
However, as I mentioned previously, it is not just the numbers that are important, but also the assumptions behind them. As many reinsurance policies have infrequent but large claim risks, the actual claims associated with a policy often will not come for many years after a policy is first written and premiums are earned. Thus, the management or underwriting team has to make estimates of the future claims associated with a certain tranche of written policies. This means that many of the figures previously presented, particularly the loss ratios and the combined ratios, depend significantly on the assumptions of the management. If management wanted, it could estimate very few losses in any particular year, increasing the likelihood that they would need to adjust estimates upward in the ensuing years. This is why in the analysis of an insurance company a potential investor is heavily dependent on the conservatism of the management in estimating those losses and on writing business in accordance with those conservative estimates.
Without going into all the esoteric details around reserve setting and insurance accounting, one of the few ways an investor can ascertain if management really has been conservative in their underwriting is to look at the development of individual years of underwriting as they progress over time. This is captured in what is called a loss reserve development table. For General Re’s North American business, this table from its 10K form is summarized in
table 17.3
. The two top rows of numbers represent the best estimate of liabilities for each underwriting year in the year they were made, i.e., 1987 is based on the estimate made in 1987, and 1997 is based on the estimate in 1997. The development of those estimates is then traced for each underwriting year in each column as the years pass. For the 1987 underwriting year, there are 10 years of figures. For the 1997 years, on the other hand, there is simply one estimate.
Table 17.3.
Analysis of North American net claims and claim expense development
Looking at
table 17.3
, one can see that for the underwriting years between 1987 and 1991, all the liability estimates had significant negative developments since their initial estimate. For example, the estimate of the liabilities associated with policies underwritten in 1987 was first calculated at approximately $4.7 billion. Over the next 10 years, this increased almost 30 percent, to $6.1 billion. Clearly, management had not been conservative enough when they first made their estimates of liabilities. Over time, they had to add to reserves to fill this gap. For the liabilities associated with the 1987 underwriting year, about $250 million was added in year six (1993) and year seven (1994), and about $300 million was added in year eight (1995). It is likely that this information would have been something of a red flag to a potential investor in 1997. What it means is that for years like 1987, the management clearly had not been conservative enough when they first made their estimates of liabilities.

Were I considering investing in General Re in 1997, I would want to be convinced that (a) the management team was significantly more conservative than they seemed to have been in 1987 and (b) that the reserve additions for years that were underreserved are now completed, i.e., no additional reserve-adding would be needed. The dangers of underreserving have been revealed through many examples in history. The one I am most familiar with is the more recent case of UK auto insurers between 2002 and 2010. During that time the UK motor (automobile) insurance industry faced a tumultuous period with an industry combined ratio that started below 100 in 2002 and ended at around 115 by 2010. During this eight-year stretch, many companies were required to add to their reserves repeatedly and some of them had to exit lines of business altogether. The lesson from this case is that when reserves are added by an insurance company, this is often only the first step in rectifying a problem that takes several adjustments to rectify, and, further, some companies can hide their underreserving for several years through trying to “outgrow” their problem by generating additional revenues and float. At times companies did this by writing cheap policies that were not conservative, thereby creating a long-term problem while trying to solve a short-term one. Of course, an investor looking at General Re in 1987 would not have had access to this exact case study, but he or she would have been able to anticipate these types of problems as the logical outcomes of reckless underwriting.
Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company’s true cost of float. An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what’s presented.
—Buffett to Berkshire Hathaway investors, February 27, 1998.
There are a few aspects of General Re that would, however, have appeased the nervous investor. The development of underwriting in the years between 1993 and 1996 seemed much more positive, with reserve releases rather than additions. And even for those earlier years that were underreserved, the rate of reserve increases stabilized somewhat. This indicates that in the last few years the business was much more conservatively operated.
Having covered the bases on the underwriting side, one must now turn to the income side of the General Re business. In 1997, General Re had an investment income pretax of $1.29 billion and after tax of $969 million. This return was generated from insurance investments totaling $24.6 billion, suggesting a pretax return of 5.2 percent and after-tax return of 3.9 percent. The shareholders’ equity in the business was $8.16 billion at the end of the year, suggesting a pretax ROE of 15.8 percent and an after-tax return of 11.9 percent. These are also fairly decent numbers, but not outstanding. Wells Fargo, for instance, had an ROE of 24 percent in the year before Buffett’s investment.
As shown in the consolidated balance sheet (see
table 17.9
), the bulk of the investments—about $16 billion—were in fixed income products, as could be expected for an insurance business trying to minimize risk and match the duration of assets and liabilities. Although not formally detailed, note that there is also $352 million of revenue associated with noninsurance and investment revenues, presumably from financial services. Accounting for approximately $100 million pretax operating profits, this seemed to be a highly profitable side business for General Re.
Before I move on to valuation, a few words must be said about the management team of General Re. Because I was concerned about the previous underwriting practices of General Re, I would have been interested in learning whether the company had a rationale for a dramatic improvement toward conservative underwriting sometime around 1993 in the form of a new management team. From the description of the management team in the 1997 annual report, it seems that there was no real change in the management; the CEO, Ronald Ferguson, had held his position since 1987, and the CFO, Joseph Brandon, had been with the company since 1989 (although only since 1997 in the CFO role). Thus, the investor is left in the dark as to the reason for the dramatic change in management’s underwriting conservatism. Moving to valuation, an investor has a clear source for what this looked like when Buffett purchased the whole business. In Berkshire Hathaway’s announcement document on June 19, 1989 regarding the acquisition of General Re by Berkshire, Berkshire quotes a total acquisition price of $22 billion, which represents $276.50 per share. Calibrating this with the information contained in the 1997 10K document of General Re, one sees that the share price of General Re ranged between $151 and $219 per share with a closing price of $212 per share at year-end. Hence, Buffett paid a premium of approximately 30 percent to the year-end share price of General Re in 1997.
Since General Re is a financial institution, a look at PER and P/B based on the 1997 year-end metrics is warranted:
Table 17.5.

Based on the historical earnings of 1997, General Re was trading at a multiple of 23 times. This would seem like a remarkably high multiple to pay even for an outstanding business. The price that Buffett paid for Wells Fargo, another financial company, was a mere six times net earnings per share of the previous full year.
Looking at P/B, one sees the following:

Again, at 2.7 times book value based on 1997 year-end shareholders’ equity, General Re seems quite expensive. Wells Fargo traded at a P/B ratio of 1.1 times and had a ROE of 24 percent in the full year prior to the investment. General Re traded at a P/B ratio of 2.7 times and had a ROE of 12 percent after taxes. This seems significantly more expensive.
Had I been considering General Re for investment at the time, I would have seen it as an above-average reinsurance operation, but would have had significant concerns about management’s conservatism in underwriting. At 23.5 times 1997 PER and 2.7 times book value, I would have found General Re very expensive given the business’s ability to generate a ROE of 12 percent in 1997. Considering General Re at the price of year-end 1997, $212 per share, the valuation would have been a PER of 18 and P/B of two. I would have found this a more reasonable valuation, but no home run for a business that had grown net income by seven percent per annum over the previous 10 years. As a standalone business, I would not have seen an amazing company. In the actual investment case, it seems that Buffett’s investment rationale must have focused on some of the expertise that General Re would bring along with the large float it had, which Buffett likely would have been able to reinvest at healthy returns. As an investment case, potential investors would have been able to find and invest in General Re if they were looking for well-run insurance businesses.
***
Buffett’s own explanation for his acquisition of the company, which he provided in a letter to Berkshire shareholders for year-end 1998, shows that he took a somewhat different stance than I deduced based on the aforementioned numbers. Buffett comments that “for many decades, General Re’s name has stood for quality, integrity and professionalism in reinsurance—and under Ron Ferguson’s leadership, this reputation has been burnished still more…there is a lot they can teach us.” Along with the positive opinion of the management team and overall business at the time, Buffett goes on to explain that a General Re/Berkshire combination will give the combined business a unique structural advantage of being able to confidently absorb any earnings volatility, which is inherent in a good reinsurance business that writes policies based on expected returns rather than earnings smoothness. Specifically, unlike other publically listed standalone reinsurance companies, General Re would no longer have to worry about being penalized by investors who do not like earnings volatility and can focus solely on writing profitable policies even if they include ones that will likely be volatile. Buffett goes on to describe the ability that General Re would have in expanding Berkshire’s worldwide distribution for selling insurance products and the technical abilities in underwriting it would bring to the Berkshire businesses. Surprisingly, in this case Buffett’s investment is only partially based on financials—it is also based on business rationales for the acquisition.
