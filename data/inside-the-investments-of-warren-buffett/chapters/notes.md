NOTES
Part I. The Partnership Years (1957–1968)
1
. Buffett Partnership Limited would soon be composed of numerous individual partnerships including Buffett Associates, Buffett Fund, Dacee, Emdee, Glenoff, Mo-Buff, and Underwood between 1956 and 1969.

. Warren Buffett to Buffett Partnership Limited, January 30, 1961, 10.
7
. I assume $100,000 net income based on applying the 27 percent tax rate paid by Sanborn Map Co. in 1959 to its $132,120 operating income from its operating business, and rounding. For the purpose of showing the earnings power of just the operating business, I have excluded the income from investments. Buffett quoted “after-tax profits of the map business…under $100,000 in 1958 and 1959” in his 1960 partnership letter.
8
. When looking once more at the Sanborn Map Financial Data box, the Moody’s document, a potential investor at the time would have been able to confirm the presence of this investment portfolio, but only if this investor was very detail oriented. In fact, the balance sheet figures merely show investment assets of $2.6 million at cost. One needs to see the footnote that references the market value of these assets of $7.3 million.

3
. We could make a rough estimate of the percentage of Dempster Mill’s revenue stemming from aftersales based on a comment by Buffett in his annual letter. In the letter he stated that when Harry Bottle, his hired manager, raised prices on spare parts, an additional $200K was generated in profits per year. If we assume he raised prices by about 20 percent, which in my experience is possible when a company moves from having no aftersales strategy to having one, we can infer that sales on spare parts would be approximately $1 million. If we assume that an equal amount of service revenue also existed, we can infer that 20 to 25 percent of total revenues came from aftersales—certainly a meaningful amount.
4
. There are numerous ways of defining a net-net, and the one I used is to take only the current assets (cash, receivables, inventory, and other current assets), subtract all liabilities, and take two-thirds of this value. By this definition, the math for Dempster would look as follows: net-net value = ([$5491K − $2318K]/60146) *
⅔
= $52.75 per share *
⅔
= $35.17 per share. This is 20 percent above the $28 per share price Buffett paid.

3
. I used the details given in Buffett’s annual letter to calculate projected returns based on his acquisition prices. As Buffett had purchased the securities in a span of a few months, all numbers are estimates based on gains reflecting the average rate of return we are given or specific purchase prices. I also made the assumption that the warrants and common equity were trading similar discounts to the estimated deal price.
4
. Specifically on the common equity price, Buffett’s average price purchased can be calculated at about $6.92 per share. However, I assume that because he made purchases throughout the period between April and October 1962, the price of the common in April was lower, and by an amount consistent with the overall rate of return.

. I calculate the EV by multiplying the shares outstanding (1,017,547) by the share price of $14.69 and adding the net cash at EOY 1965 of $3.68 million from the balance sheet of the annual report. The EV I use is $11.3 million (market cap $14.9 million). Note that during the year, Berkshire had repurchased 120,231 of its own shares in the open market from a year start shares outstanding number of 1,137,778. EPS in 1965 is calculated based on 1,017,547 shares out.

After the preferred convertible share offering brokered by Salomon, there would have been a dilutive effect to the extent of 8.2 million additional shares based on $76 million raised at $9.20 per preferred shares. However, this would also have added capital to the business.

22. What We Can Learn from Buffett
1
. BlackBerry (formerly known as Research in Motion) had reported revenues of CAD 24.8 billion in 2011 and CAD 4.6 billion in 2014.
2
. Buffett discusses the relative abundance of opportunities in the three different categories of investments along with his ability to realize them in several different instances. One instance is the 1961 letter to the Buffett Partnership dated January 24, 1962, in which he discussed realizing relatively more control situations as his increasing capital allowed him to do so.
