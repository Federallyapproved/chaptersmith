What We Can Learn from Buffett
Over the years, Warren Buffett has discussed almost every topic related to investing, either through one of his letters to shareholders or in an interview or article. Drawing from these discussions, one could assemble a laundry list of investment advice that includes anything from how to look at risk versus reward to how to think about portfolio concentration. But since this book focuses on what an investment analyst working at the time would have seen when considering the companies Buffett invested in, I will keep my learning points to those that I think are most critical to becoming a better investor. These lessons learned represent my own best interpretation of the major takeaways from analyzing Buffett’s twenty key investments (as covered in this book) and include a combination of ideas I found especially insightful as well as those that are fundamental enough to deserve restating—even if they are not new to a well-studied value investor. As such, this list is by nature at least partially subjective. I encourage the reader to draw additional lessons based on his or her own view of the evidence presented.
A. Quality of Information
Most value investors who have followed Buffett know that he believed in conducting fundamental research and investing in a concentrated fashion once this research was done. Investing, according to Buffett, should be like having a punch card with only twenty holes, each representing one investment that an investor could make over his whole lifetime. Generally less understood, however, is what good research meant to Buffett and why it made sense for him to be concentrated rather than diversified in his investments.
One fact that stood out to me when analyzing Buffett’s investments was the quality of information he had on the companies in which he invested. Take Burlington Northern Santa Fe, for example. When Buffett looked to invest in the company, the level of information that he had (and, I would argue, that any dedicated analyst would have been able to obtain) was extremely high. In its publically available annual reports, BNSF included not only detailed financial information, but also the most relevant operating metrics of its rail business. This included, among other things, revenue ton-miles traveled, freight revenue per thousand tons, and customer satisfaction scores. These metrics were reported consistently over several years, so potential investors have the relevant objective data they need to really understand how the business is performing year to year. Even more important, the annual report—written by long-time CEO and Chairman Matthew Rose—clearly explains each major area of the business and the key drivers in each. He details that the consumer products area, for instance, consists of 90 percent domestic and international goods transport (whose volumes depended on international trade traffic) and 10 percent automotive products distribution (whose volumes depended on the success of the regional car industry). He goes on to detail the capital requirements of the business over time and discusses why, for those product categories, rail is a more efficient method of transportation than the alternatives (most notably, trucking). Enough verifiable and objective data are thus available to support a qualitative insight necessary for a sound investment. In this case, Buffett’s insight was that future capital intensity would decrease with higher network density in such a rail business, meaning that returns on marginal capital employed would continue to improve, and that with this ever-increasing efficiency, the rails share of the overall product transport mix would likely continue to increase for many more decades.
Over and over, across very different cases, one constant in Buffett’s investing was an abundance of relevant objective data for the companies in question. For American Express, Buffett had information to support his qualitative insights into the long-term potential of credit cards and travelers cheques as well as the localized and short-term damage of the Salad Oil Scandal. Similarly, for Coca-Cola, objective data were available to confirm that international expansion and increasing consumption (in 8-oz. servings per year) across different countries would drive growth. So while it is certainly true that Buffett was diligent in learning about all aspects of a business, Buffett focused especially on investment cases that could be bolstered by concrete objective data points.
This information did not always come from annual reports, but industry data as well. The Association of American Railroads published detailed operational data (such as operating ratios and downtimes) on a monthly basis for every major railroad in the United States. This gave investors a measure of not only how one railroad performed month to month and year to year, but also how it compared to others. Similarly, in the case of
Buffalo Evening News
, circulation figures for Buffalo area newspapers and advertising data at the industry level were available. Buffett gravitated toward industries where the level of objective data available was high—further supporting the lesson that access to high-quality information is crucial for successful investing. Without high-quality information to support one’s qualitative insights, the best path is probably just not to invest.
A likely result of this is Buffett’s strategy of revisiting certain industries again and again. I would argue that Buffett increasingly focused his investments in a select few industries because this helped him hone and understand what high-quality information meant and how to deploy this knowledge repeatedly. For example, knowing the detailed subscription numbers, churn rates, and operating margins of the
Washington Post
undoubtedly helped in evaluating the investment case for the
Buffalo News
. On the whole, it also seems that the industries Buffett revisits—media, insurance, and branded products—were ones with ample objective industry information. By having great objective information, Buffett could confidently make the big bets that defined his concentrated approach to investing.
B. Consistency of Earnings Growth
Most investors who have followed Buffett associate him with investments in “high-quality” businesses, where high-quality denotes a company with an enduring brand name (like Coca-Cola or American Express) or one that’s a “compounder” with high returns of capital. While both of these criteria were part of Buffett’s consideration, what I want to highlight, and what I believe is even more important, is the consistency of performance, specifically of revenue and earnings.
Let me explain. Most value investors look for businesses with “moats”—durable competitive advantages. For many, this means time spent actively searching for network effects, switching costs, scale benefits, and other such qualitative signs of advantages. On the quantitative side is detailed analysis of current earnings and returns. The preferred metric, which is also roughly what Buffett looked at, is cash earnings after considering maintenance (CAPEX for maintenance). Another frequent quantitative focus for value investors is return on tangible capital employed as defined by either the aforementioned earnings divided by total capital employed or some form of marginal capital employed. While all of these factors are relevant and worthy of scrutiny, the lesson gleaned from analyzing Buffett’s investments is that all of them are secondary to being able to make a dependable prediction of the future prospects of a company.
The majority of the investments covered in this book were in companies that had extremely consistent revenue and earnings growth in the years preceding Buffett’s investment. Many of these companies had grown revenues or earnings nine out of the previous ten years—remarkable given that few companies perform at this level. Buffett clearly valued consistent historical financials and good data, and used this to understand the qualitative reasons for a business’s consistent growth (in revenue or earnings) and the rationale that such performance would continue. His insight about American Express, for example, was that more international travel would mean a greater need for American Express’s travelers cheques. For Burlington Northern Santa Fe, his insight was that cargo transport by rail would continue to take market share from trucking, and that this would continue because of the inherently more fuel-efficient nature of rail transport. But why is looking for consistently good performance even more important than looking for competitive advantages or compounders or current earnings? I will address competitive advantages first.
In my experience, explicitly looking for competitive advantages is quite imprecise. Sometimes one can articulate and understand an actual competitive advantage, but one must have consistent historical financials or data of some sort to confirm this. Otherwise, explicitly looking for competitive advantages can lead to finding moats that simply do not exist in a meaningful way. Take, for example, the once-common argument that BlackBerry had a moat with its subscription model and its private servers. While some of that may have been true, financially this simply did not matter as the business’s revenue shrunk by over 80 percent between 2011 and 2014, and earnings became negative.

Looking for evidence in the form of numbers and objective data seems to be a more dependable way of determining an actual structural advantage—rather than just theorizing one.
When it comes to compounders and current earnings (which many investors will devote disproportionate time to calculate precisely to the nth degree), the argument is even more straightforward. Determining current earnings is important; it gives an investor a sense of what the valuation of the business is. And understanding the return on capital of a business is important as well; without a return on capital that is significantly higher than the cost of capital, a business cannot compound. However, the true value of a business is the aggregate of its future earnings. It does not matter so much if an investor gets current earnings exactly right at $80 or $82 or $79—it matters much more if the future earnings in five years are around $700 or $15 or $3000. Similarly, while having a high return on capital is one requirement for compounding, if the future prospects of a company are unclear, then having a high return on capital is clearly insufficient. A business that has a wonderful 50 percent return on capital employed but that grows its revenues or earnings zero percent has exactly zero benefit from its high return on capital compared to a company with lesser returns, since it will not be able to reinvest its earnings into growing the business.
Given this, I now believe that rather than spending 80 percent of one’s research time determining with extreme accuracy what current earnings in the last year were or a establishing a precise return on capital for a business, one should spend significantly more time looking for businesses with great consistency in earnings growth and finding quality data that support a clear rationale why this growth is occurring. One should not fall victim to the phenomenon of being precise but wrong.
C. Letting Opportunities Drive Your Investment Style
In today’s world of investing, many investors define their investment strategy by one approach, such as “value,” or “growth,” or “event driven.” Buffett transcended such types; he did not invest only in cheap net-nets or only quality businesses or only preferred shares. Instead, he matched his investment strategy to market conditions and his personal investment setup.
One can take a closer look at how Buffett did this. In his 1961 year-end partnership letter, Buffett details three types of investments that are at the core of his partnership’s investment strategy. The first category was “generals”: securities he considered significantly undervalued compared to their intrinsic value. This included most of what one would consider typical value investments—long only investments in companies that are cheap compared to asset values or earnings. There is not a definite timeline for when this undervaluation would be corrected, says Buffett, but over time he expected that on the whole these investments would appreciate. As a result, an investor gets a lot of value for the price paid. His experience was that this category of stocks was correlated with the markets, and hence would decline when the market declined and gain when the market gained. However, given their undervaluation, he expected them to have a significant
margin of safety
; when markets declined, these would decline relatively less than the market.
The second category of investments discussed was “workouts.” These were companies where the financial returns depended on corporate actions—mergers, liquidations, reorganizations, spin-offs, and so forth. According to Buffett, this category of investments should be much less dependent on the market, and he expected a fairly steady average return between 10 and 20 percent. As such, this category of investments should significantly outperform a declining market but likely will not match strongly advancing markets. Moreover, these investments (unlike general undervalued events) usually resolve at a determinable timeline, in line with the corporate actions.
The third category of investments that Buffett mentioned were situations in which the partnership can either directly control a company or own a large enough stake to actively influence operations. While these situations might result from one of the previous two categories of investments, Buffett’s focus here is on influencing a company to unlock hidden value in assets, working capital, or (later in his career) operational improvements. He called these “control situations.”
His overall goal was to use a combination of all three investment types to outperform the market in the long term. His hope, he said, was to incur smaller losses than the market in significantly declining markets, while only matching or slightly underperforming markets that are rapidly advancing. Buffett referred to building a pipeline of opportunities; the best investment type changes depending on market conditions, and the investor must recognize and respond to this flux in order to identify the most promising opportunities.

While flexible in the investment types he considered, Buffett remained adamant about his hurdles. When no great public companies could be had for a reasonable price, he invested in more merger arbitrage deals; when those dried up, he looked at private companies. In 1968, when he could not find opportunities in any of those categories, he disbursed his partnership rather than compromise on his investment criteria. If his investment requirement was to have a 50 percent
margin of safety
to intrinsic value for undervalued general investments, then he did not budge until he found such an opportunity. If it meant that he had to have absolute trust in the management’s ability to allocate capital wisely, he did not bend on this.
The lesson here is that investors should not force one investment style upon the market. Instead, they should develop expertise in several types of investments that suit different investment environments and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves. When opportunities seem to be drying up, do not compensate by loosening one’s investment criteria.
D. It’s All About Management
One aspect of Warren Buffett’s approach has remained a constant through the years: his paramount focus on good management. While other renowned value investors (such as Walter Schloss and Benjamin Graham) focused little on assessing management, Buffett spent a huge amount of time understanding and evaluating a company’s management. In so many cases—Jack Ringwalt of National Indemnity, Tom Murphy of Cap Cities/ABC, and even John Gutfreund of Salomon, just to mention a few—Buffett had known the management for years before his investment. And when he owns a company, he devotes considerable time to overseeing and supporting management as needed. Even when considered among investors who assess management as part of their investment process, Buffett goes far beyond what I think is the norm.
In assessing management, one criterion Buffett clearly looks for is a history of operational success. Take Jack Ringwalt at National Indemnity. Ringwalt cofounded the business with his brother Arthur in 1940 and built it up from scratch. By 1967, when Buffett invested, he spent over twenty-five years running the company successfully and balancing risks and growth prospects. The same track record of success was apparent in the larger public companies Buffett invested in: American Express’s CEO Howard Clark and Coca-Cola’s CEO Roberto Goizueta were both proven managers who had been in roles for at least several years. Another similarity among these managers was the detailed and honest annual reports they wrote, which shed unusual insight into their businesses. It was exceptional for Buffett to invest in a company without seeing a history of success from the manager. One notable instance was the
Washington Post
, where Katharine Graham took over the business when Fritz Beebe died unexpectedly. But even in this case, Buffett did get to know the three divisional managers who ran the operations—John Prescott of newspapers, Osborn Elliott of
Newsweek
, and Larry Israel of broadcasting. This was in addition to his extensive mentoring of Graham later on.
Buffett especially seemed to value owner-managers—CEOs who are either an owner in the business or who are otherwise personally devoted or connected to the business. Some cases were very clear cut; Jack Ringwalt at National Indemnity and Rose Blumkin of Nebraska Furniture Mart were owner-managers who founded their businesses. So was Katharine Graham because she was the granddaughter of the founder of the
Washington Post
. In several other instances, the managers were owner-managers by virtue of being incentivized through a direct profit-sharing agreement or being handpicked by Buffett based on a personal relationship to him or to the business. These managers included Harry Bottle at Dempster Mill, Ken Chace at Berkshire Hathaway, Stan Lipsey at
Buffalo Evening News
, and Walter Scott and David Sokol at MidAmerican Energy. Even in the cases where large corporations obviously had professional managers, Buffett invested in companies where those managers had a very long and well-defined history with their company; Tom Murphy at Capital Cities, Carl Reichardt at Wells Fargo, Ronald Ferguson at General Re, and Matthew Rose at BNSF all had been with their various companies for more than ten years, and in some cases over twenty-five years. Buffett preferred owner-managers because they had the same interests as he would have had as a long-term owner of the business.
Buffett had several other criteria for managers. He believed that a manager should have the utmost integrity, otherwise they may hurt investors far more by being smart than by being dumb. He also valued managers with the ability to allocate capital wisely, although he was also willing to teach a manager the conservative approach he espoused rather than insist that they be masters of this approach to begin with. Buffett clearly considered management one of the most important criteria, or even the most iimportant criterion, in finding a good investment. He spent an immense amount of time getting to know, evaluating, and guiding managers, searching for honest people with proven track records of success and who cared deeply about the businesses that they led.
Final Thoughts
Demystifying Warren Buffett is no easy task. Nevertheless, the lessons that can be drawn from studying the activities and strategies implemented by Buffett can be immensely insightful. In this book I have tried to take one specific approach in exploring the details of Buffett’s investment fundamentals during several different periods in his career. My focus was foremost on Buffett’s role approaching individual investment cases and understanding from a third-party perspective what rationale he or any investor may have seen in each situation. Within this context, I also attempted to present Buffett’s evolution as an investor over time. My hope is that the reader can learn from the specific evidence presented in the investment case studies as well as from relating Buffett’s evolution as an investor to his or her own unique investing experience.
One question that is frequently asked by investors is to what extent can an individual investor replicate the investments of Warren Buffett? After looking at the twenty investment that I believe were the most significant of his investment career, I would contend that actually a fair number of them would have been possible for a private investor. This is especially true for those investments made in the later part of Buffett’s career. And even for those investments, which were private transactions and would have been impossible for most investors to execute, it still is the case that many of the lessons learned in them were often applicable to similar public company opportunities. The primary limitation that I see would be the fact that Buffett found on average only several good investment opportunities each year, and that this was based on exspending a full-time effort. But if one is willing to dedicate significant amounts of time and be patient, I truly believe that one can directly apply many of the lessons in Buffett’s investments to improve one’s own investment approach.
