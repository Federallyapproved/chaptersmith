1977: The
Buffalo Evening News
The
Buffalo Evening News
was first brought up as an investment idea by Vincent Manno, a newspaper broker shortly before Christmas 1976 at a dinner party organized by
Newsweek
. Although Manno intended to present the newspaper as an acquisition target for the
Washington Post
, Warren Buffett, a close friend of Katharine Graham, was at the party and also heard about the deal. When Graham decided that the paper was not a good fit for the
Washington Post
, Buffett decided to invest in the newspaper himself for Berkshire Hathaway.
The
Buffalo Evening News
was being sold by the estate of the late Kate Robinson Butler (Mrs. Edward H. Butler, Jr.). Founded in 1873 by Edward Hubert Butler, Sr., it was originally a Sunday-only newspaper. Over the years it transitioned to an opposite schedule and was released daily Monday through Saturday. By 1977, it had become one of only two major newspapers in Buffalo; the other newspaper was the
Buffalo Courier-Express
. With both papers under family ownership, it was widely known that a gentlemen’s agreement between the families had resulted in the
Evening News
being exclusively an afternoon newspaper, while the
Courier-Express
maintained morning editions seven days a week, including an important Sunday edition.
The two papers shared the Buffalo, New York market, and while Buffalo was neither a large city nor one with a promising economic outlook, it nevertheless had a fantastically loyal newspaper readership with a higher percentage of local household subscriptions than any other big city in the country.

In this market, the
Evening News
enjoyed a higher readership circulation during the week—268,000 compared to the
Courier-Express
’s 123,000.
2
Key to this success was the strong brand name of the
Evening News
and its long history in the city. Still, the
Evening News
was not particularly profitable; in 1976, it had a total operating profit of $1.7 million, which represented an operating profit margin of approximately four percent.
3
The lack of an
Evening News
Sunday edition clearly hobbled the paper. By the 1970s, it was one of the few newspapers in the country to take the old-fashioned approach of having no Sunday release. This was a major source of missed revenue because Sunday was when many families had the most time to read—a fact not lost on advertisers, who would pay a premium to run ads in the Sunday edition. Without this key component, the paper feared that it would soon start losing market share to the
Courier-Express
. Another fundamental concern was that the
Evening News
operated in a market that was strongly unionized.
4
Looking past these negatives, however, the
Evening News
was a high-quality business. It had a strong repeat customer base of loyal readers and advertisers due to its strong name recognition and circulation during the week.
Because the
Evening News
was a private company, a potential investor would only have had a few clues on which to base a financial assessment. According to a solicitation letter sent to advertisers in May 1977, of the 471,515 households located in the relevant Buffalo area, the
Evening News
daily edition covered 58 percent, and its Saturday edition covered 61 percent, compared to 24 percent of the households covered by the weekday
Courier-Express
and 53 percent covered by the Sunday
Courier-Express
.
5
So it was known that the
Evening News
was the leading paper in the city and had a circulation in the hundreds of thousands. General knowledge of the newspaper business would help a potential investor better understand the opportunity. If well run, a newspaper business was a fantastic business both in terms of return on capital and profit margins. The
Washington Post
in 1977, for example, made an after-tax return on tangible capital of 43 percent and had an operating profit margin of 16 percent.
6
As Buffett and other potential investors would have known, a newspaper business is a relatively capital-light business; printing equipment and some facilities are needed, but the key resource of a newspaper is the quality of its editorial team and its brand among readers and advertisers. These factors are what determine profitability, and that of the
Buffalo Evening News
seemed significantly lower than what it should have been given its strong position in the market.
Before turning to the valuation of the
Evening News
, another key aspect to consider is the management situation at the newspaper, which was in flux in 1977. Kate Robinson Butler had run the paper until her death in 1974, when Henry Z. Urban was appointed by the Butler estate as the new publisher. Investors would have realized that Urban’s short tenure opened up the opportunity for significant changes to the team.
In 1977, Buffett purchased the entire business for $32.5 million. This was a significant investment for him (through his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway); his estimated net worth at the time was only about $70 million.
7
In terms of valuation, this represented a very high multiple (EV/EBIT of 19) based on the
Evening News
’s $1.7 million operating income in 1976. Buffett likely saw three upsides in making this purchase. First, he saw a business he liked and understood. Buffett had by this time accumulated plenty of knowledge about media companies, and he knew the demographics that would make a newspaper business a good one, in particular through his involvement with the
Washington Post
. He likely thought that the readership of the
Evening News
in Buffalo and its reputation fit this picture. Second, he saw a business where significant improvements were possible. Noting a low profit margin, obvious opulence in the offices, and high salaries in comparison with peers, Buffett likely saw many opportunities to improve the net income figures. And of course, there was the lack of a Sunday edition. With the
Courier-Express
barely profitable,
8
publishing on Sunday could make the
Evening News
the only major newspaper in Buffalo. Third, Buffett knew that he could bring in new management talent to run the business, and he had individuals in his personal network, including Stan Lipsey (former head of Buffett’s newspaper, the
Omaha Sun
), who were ideal candidates for this task. As Buffett noted later in his 1977 letter to shareholders,
9
publisher Henry Urban and editor Murray Light were people he and Charlie Munger admired. But they also knew that there were others, like Lipsey, who could help transform the business.
Despite these opportunities, the road to success was not easy. First, there were legal issues. Immediately after Buffett’s purchase of the
Evening News
a Sunday edition launched, with a free introductory offer to its regular weekday customers. Fearing for its livelihood, the
Courier-Express
brought a lawsuit against the
Evening News
on grounds of monopolistic behavior. The case was presided over by Judge Charles L. Brieant, Jr. in U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York, and the initial verdict was against the
Evening News
, limiting its ability to promote its Sunday edition aggressively. But in 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed the earlier decision, allowing the
Evening News
more freedom in competing aggressively against the
Courier-Express
. This competition became an all-out war, and both newspapers lost money for the next few years. By 1982, total accumulated losses for the
Evening News
amounted to $12.5 million since 1977. Then in September 1982, the
Courier-Express
shut down. In the
Evening News
’s first year as a monopoly, the paper—now renamed the
Buffalo News
—made $19 million in pretax profits.
10
In the following years, business went from good to great. In 1986, the
Buffalo News
made a pretax profit of $35 million, more than the total purchase price of the business paid by Buffett nine years earlier. In the Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders of that year, Buffett reported, “The
Buffalo News
has the highest weekday penetration rate (the percentage of households in the paper’s primary marketing area purchasing it each day) among any of the top 50 papers in the country. Our Sunday penetration, where we are also number one, is even more impressive. It now has a penetration ratio of 83 percent and sells about 100,000 copies more each Sunday than did the
Courier-Express
ten years ago.”
Although the investment clearly worked out for Buffett, it would not have been an easy decision for a potential investor considering investing in the
Evening News
in 1977. The competition the newspaper faced was significant, and at the time the paper had limited profitability. An investment for the price that Buffett paid would have meant paying a very high multiple on the earnings at the time—banking on the assumption that the future profitability of the newspaper would be significantly more than its past profitability.
A key insight to Buffett’s decision to invest in the
Evening News
seemed to be exactly this conviction about the positive future prospects of the newspaper. With an extensive understanding of how newspaper businesses worked, he seemed comfortable in making the call that the stronger newspaper in a two-paper city with the demographics of Buffalo would eventually win at the expense of the weaker one. Ultimately, Buffett clearly believed that the profitability of the
Evening News
could be improved significantly with just a few operational changes, and he must also have seen a significant chance that the
Evening News
would become the monopoly paper in Buffalo.
