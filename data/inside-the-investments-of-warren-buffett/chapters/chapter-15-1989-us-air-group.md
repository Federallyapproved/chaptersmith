1989: US Air Group
As with the Salomon deal, Warren Buffett’s 1988 investment in US Air involved preferred shares: a $358 million purchase of preferred stock with a mandatory redemption in 10 years at a dividend rate of 9.25 percent and a right to convert into common shares at a price of $60 per share. The common shares were valued at around $35 per share at the time, reflecting a total market capitalization for US Air of approximately $1.5 billion. Although the investment was profitable in the end, the US Air deal is often cited as an example of an investment mistake for Buffett. Even in his own annual letters, Buffett discusses the shortcomings of the investment and his failure to correctly identify its investment prospects. For instance, in his annual letter to shareholders year-end 1996, Buffett states:
I liked and admired Ed Colodny, the company’s then-CEO, and I still do. But my analysis of US Air’s business was both superficial and wrong. I was so beguiled by the company’s long history of profitable operations, and by the protection that ownership of a senior security seemingly offered me, that I overlooked the crucial point: US Air’s revenues would increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits. These costs, if left unchecked, portended disaster, however reassuring the airline’s past record might be.
Figure 15.1.
It is easy to criticize investment decisions in hindsight. A more interesting question is, what would a potential investor realistically have seen in US Air at the time? To answer this, we must turn to the US Air annual report for 1988, the latest full-year report before Buffett’s purchase.
The report begins with financial highlights, showing that US Air made a net income of $165 million on revenues of $5.71 billion in 1988. The prior year was also profitable for the company, with a net income of $194 million on $3 billion of revenues. The overall picture, from these financial highlights and the ensuing operating review by Chairman and President Ed Colodny, was that US Air was a profitable business undergoing huge changes in scope. The company had just completed the integration of its acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and was starting to integrate Piedmont Airlines, which was to merge in 1989. Together, these two acquisitions had more than doubled the size of US Air’s operations, adding routes throughout the United States. Organically, at year-end 1988, US Air had confirmed orders for 83 new airplanes (order value of $2 billion) to be delivered between 1989 and 1991, with an optional 108 airplanes (order value of $3 billion). The confirmed orders alone would add 20 percent to US Air’s total existing jet fleet.
In addition to rapid growth, there are three other notable takeaways from the annual report. First, while revenues increased exponentially in 1988 (by 90 percent from 1987), net income actually decreased. Some of this divergence can be attributed to exceptional costs related to merger integration and a one-off write-down of BAC 1-11 aircraft (outdated aircraft in its fleet), but even adjusting for these costs, US Air’s operating earnings (preexceptional costs) increased by only 36 percent—much slower than revenue growth. A closer inspection of the income statement shows that the culprit was operating expenses, which had increased even faster than revenues—by 97 percent. Within the category of operating expenses, personnel costs, rentals and landing fees, and aircraft maintenance costs grew fastest. Although a one-year dramatic increase in operating costs does not indicate permanent cost inflation, it certainly raises a concern about how controllable some of these costs were. Were landing fees charged by airports and pilot wages increasing unchecked, as rapid growth in air-traffic squeezed resources? What exposure was there to fuel cost increases, and were there any controls over these costs?
The second takeaway builds on the first, as it brings up even more risks and uncertainties that should have been apparent to a potential investor: debt and operating leases. To fund the two large acquisitions—PSA and Piedmont—US Air issued $1 billion of new debt in 1987 in the form of a credit agreement. A portion of this was repaid in 1988 by issuing commercial paper, but at the end of that year US Air still had significant financial debt of approximately $1.5 billion,
1
which had covenants, repayment schedules, and all the other risks of significant debt. Making things much riskier, US Air had noncancellable operating leases of $6.4 in addition to financial debt (as detailed on page 23 of the report). These are the obligations that US Air had committed to pay for the future lease of aircraft, ground facilities, and other equipment. Compared to US Air’s operating earnings of $434 million, the gross value of this amount was absolutely huge. As with the interest due on financial debt, these costs would be no problem if business went well. But if business were to deteriorate, these payment obligations could become problematic, and the company would risk insolvency.
The third notable fact relates to US Air’s business economics, which has two aspects: (1) uncertainty and (2) mediocrity.
(1) Uncertainty:
In assessing the quality of the business, a key element is what returns on capital employed it can generate. To calculate this, we must first be able to accurately estimate a steady-state earnings level. For US Airways, this is anything but easy. The first challenge is earnings cyclicality. US Air’s selected financial data in
table 15.1
show that net income margin can be more than twice as high (around 7.5 percent) in good years than in bad years (around three percent).

To smooth out the cyclicality, a potential investor could use the average last three years’ net income margin of 4.9 percent. This may be appropriate for a business that has year-to-year cyclicality but is otherwise in a steady state. However, US Air had neither of these characteristics. Instead, it faced general business cyclicality that had no predictable timeline and was difficult to forecast. It was certainly not in steady state, as its rapid string of acquisitions masked both exceptional integration costs as well as potentially different margins inherent to the original US Air business and the acquired businesses. Although all these factors add greatly to uncertainty, an investor would still ordinarily be able to ballpark a sustainable earnings figure (by assuming average historical margins with some adjustments and calculating for new steady state revenues based on summing the revenue of US Air and its acquisitions) if it were not for an even more significant complication: The entire airline industry was in a state of fundamental change. The operating statistics table from the US Air report shows this best (see
table 15.2
).

*PSA was merged into US Air on April 9, 1988.
More and more passengers were traveling by air, and the average distance traveled was increasing. At the same time, revenue per passenger mile was coming down rapidly, as airlines scrambled to reduce cost per passenger mile and increase load factors. While increased passenger demand was clearly positive for US Air, the pressure for cost reduction was certainly a negative factor. Adding to the uncertainty, fuel costs had been coming down steadily since the early 1980s, but future prices were unknown. This complexity of fundamental and opposing forces would make an accurate determination of future sustainable earnings almost impossible.
(2)
Mediocrity
: If one were to give US Air the full benefit of the doubt and assume the very successful 1987 year was reflective of its inherent ability to generate returns on capital, the calculation of ROTCE would be as follows (note that each balance sheet figure is given in dollars as well as a percentage of revenues to give both absolute and relative pictures of their importance):
(a)  PPE: $3520m (117 percent of revenues)
(b)  Other intangibles: $202m (7 percent of revenues)
(c)  Inventories: $240m (8 percent of revenues)
(d)  Accounts receivables: $343m (11 percent of revenues)
(e)  Accounts payables: −$283m (−9 percent of revenues)
(f)   Tangible capital employed (TCE): $4022m (134 percent of revenues)
Based on the 1987 operating profit (EBIT) of $319 million, the pretax return on tangible capital employed was 7.9 percent. The after-tax figure, based on an ongoing tax rate of 34 percent, was 5.2 percent. (The corporate tax rate going forward in 1988 was 34 percent; hence, this is used to recognize the intrinsic return on capital of the business.) In either case, the key point is that the US Air business was very capital intensive, with PPE (owned aircraft and facilities/equipment) amounting to more than its revenues. The resulting return on capital, even in a good year, was no higher than its cost of capital—less than eight percent (commercial paper issued by US Air in 1988 carried interest rates of 9.5 percent to 9.9 percent). This seems to point to a business with few inherent structural advantages. It diverges from the other quality businesses Buffett invested in around the same time—Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo—both of which had superior returns on tangible capital employed.
While a potential investor should have seen US Air as a cyclical business that likely had few structural advantages and had significant financial risks, there were also many positive aspects. Foremost, in Edwin Colodny, US Air had a CEO who was well respected and had an impeccable track record. By the late 1980s, Colodny had guided US Air from a small regional airline business with $500 million revenues to one of the largest airlines in the United States (see
table 15.1
). He was able to do so without having a single year of losses, even when earnings were sometimes volatile. Operationally, the US Air business improved several of its metrics under Colodny’s leadership, including passenger load factor and average passenger journey (see
table 15.2
). If US Airways was a pure execution-based business rather than one with structural competitive advantages, it was one that was well executed.
US Air had many things going for it besides just good management. Considering the operating metrics together with what was really happening, US Air was one of the preeminent U.S. airlines in 1988. It had more jet departures than any other U.S. airline and had formed strong hubs in cities like Baltimore, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. A pioneer in customer royalty, it also boasted one of the largest club networks, with 28 preferred member lounges at 24 different airports. It had both a good reputation and local density advantages resulting from its size and hub and spoke system.
The list of positives goes on. At year-end 1988, US Air had one of the youngest airline jet fleets in the industry with an average age of 8.9 years. Since younger jets require less maintenance and are more fuel-efficient, this means lower costs compared to peers. The integration with both PSA and Piedmont seemed to be going well, and although US Air was incurring exceptional costs that masked its true earnings per share, there was a convincing rationale for eventual synergies along with a natural improvement in margins as exceptional costs came to an end. For an investor who was looking for the positive side of the company, it would be fair to summarize that US Air was a well-executed business in a rapidly growing industry, and it seemed on the way to consolidating a strong position in certain regional markets. It would also have been correct to conclude that margins in 1988 were penalized by exceptional costs.
All of this analysis leads, finally, to valuation, starting with the valuation of the common equity of US Air. In 1989, the shares traded between a low of $28 and a high of $40.25. Taking $35 as a midpoint around which the stock traded for most of the year, the earnings multiple looks as follows:
Table 15.3.

EV/EBIT
*
6.6×

*
The calculation of EV is based on a market cap of $1.53 billion plus net debt of $1.34 billion = $2.87 billion.
Putting aside the earlier discussion about the inability to accurately estimate the sustainable future earnings of US Air, the historical valuation metrics look unassuming for a well-executed and growing business, even one with limited structural advantages. Adjusted for the exceptional costs associated with merger integration and the write-down of BAC 1-11 aircraft, the PER multiple for fiscal year 1988 would have been only 7.2×. Because US Air has significant debt, the PER ratio in general looks cheaper than the EV/EBIT multiple, although a 6.6× EV/EBIT multiple is also not expensive in absolute terms. This was how the valuation looked for the common shares.
Buffett, however, invested in a private placement acquiring convertible preferred shares with the qualities of a fixed yield of 9.25 percent, a conversion right for each share into common shares at $60 per share, and a mandatory redemption 10 years from issuance.
Similar to the setup in the Salomon case, the risk profile of this security is completely different from common equity. The main value of this security comes from its fixed-income quality of paying preferred dividends, which were to be paid before any other ordinary dividends by the company; the conversion feature was a bonus in case US Air became very successful and its common equity would increase in value from its current $35 per share to $60 per share. What differs in this case, compared to the Salomon case, was that the conversion feature was struck at a price much higher than the prevailing common equity price. This implies that the fixed income component was comparatively more important because reaching the equity conversion would be more difficult. Thus, an investor could consider this specific investment to be one where Buffett purchased a fixed-income security, getting a yield of 9.25 percent, which was roughly comparable to the debt issued by US Air. This security had more risks than actual US Air bonds (because those are senior to preferred shares), but also had the optional value in case US Air became even more successful in the ensuing 10 years. Specifically, looking back at the valuation of common equity, the $60 conversion feature would value US Air at an adjusted PER multiple of 12.4× based on 1988 EPS. This value is not especially expensive on a superficial level, and if US Air was able to continue its historical growth and profitability, this would be more than achievable.
All considered, US Air was an investment case where Buffett’s investment was markedly different from the choice an ordinary investor would have had. He invested in a preferred convertible share with a conversion feature at $60 per share, whereas the ordinary investor faced a common equity share at around $35 per share. Focusing specifically on the analysis of the common equity shares, a potential investor would have seen many positive aspects as well as negative ones. On the one hand, US Air looked like a leader in its industry, a well-executed business with a proven management team. On the other hand, it should have been very clear to investors that it would be difficult to predict future earnings due to significant changes in the business and its industry, as well as obviously significant risks from financial debt and operating leases. To a prudent investor, the common shares of US Air would likely have fit in the bucket of “too hard to tell.” But again, this was not what Buffett invested in.
The aftermath of the US Air investment is well documented in Buffett’s own letters to shareholders. Almost immediately after Buffett’s investment in US Air, continued route competition and intensifying pricing pressure in airfares led the entire U.S. airline industry into a lull. When the economic recession struck in 1990 and 1991 during the First Gulf War, the U.S. airline industry was decimated. Between 1991 and 1992, some of US Air’s largest peers, including Midway Airlines, Pan Am, America West, Continental, and TWA, went into bankruptcy. Compounding the issues, these carriers—no longer bound by their historical financial obligations—continued operating out of bankruptcy with even lower pricing schemes and cut-throat competition. Between 1990 and 1994, US Air lost an aggregate of $2.4 billion, wiping out its entire shareholders’ equity. In 1994, its preferred dividend on the shares owned by Buffett was suspended. Buffett wrote off three-quarters of his $358 million investment in US Air preferred shares and tried—unsuccessfully—to sell the shares in 1995 at 50 percent of face value.
2
Luckily for Buffett, business gradually improved, and when US Air finally had a good full year in 1995, the dividend on the preferred shares resumed. In fact, because Buffett had been cautious enough to structure his initial deal to include a penalty for preferred dividends that were missed, he even received extra payments above the unpaid 9.5 percent dividends. By 1997, the business had improved, and the common equity that had traded as low as $4 per share had risen to $73 per share—enough to make the conversion feature of Buffett’s preferred shares valuable.
3
Subsequently, in March 1998, the shares were called in for redemption. In total, Buffett’s investment in US Air generated dividends of more than $250 million in the eight years he had held them and were profitable through the conversion feature of the securities. Despite going through huge fundamental issues, and becoming the most infamous Buffett mistake, US Air was in fact a profitable investment.
