1987: Salomon Inc.—Preferred Stock Investments
Warren Buffett’s dalliance with Salomon started a decade before his investment in the company. Salomon had played a key role in the turnaround of GEICO, and John Gutfreund—then an executive and later Salomon’s CEO—had helped secure the financing that made GEICO’s turnaround possible. As described in Buffett’s letter to shareholders,
1
it was through this experience that Buffett had come to trust Gutfreund as a competent and fearless executive.
In September 1987, Salomon received notice that Ronald Perelman, one of the takeover kings who took over Revlon in 1985, was in discussions to acquire a major stake in Salomon. Given management concerns with a potential hostile takeover, CEO Gutfreund needed capital to prevent a South African investor from selling a 12 to 14 percent stake of the company to Perelman. After several revisions of offers, Buffett, acting as a white knight, agreed to invest in Salomon to keep Perelman out.
The Buffett deal was announced in late September 1987 and entailed a $700 million investment for convertible preferred stock in Salomon with a dividend of nine percent per year. The shares also carried the option of being converted to common stock at $38 per share after a three-year holding period. If not converted, the preferred shares were to be redeemed over a five-year period beginning in 1995. Buffett, it was said, told Gutfreund that he would be happy to buy “$700 million of Salomon preferred stock, as long as it made fifteen percent.” The conversion feature was struck so that an expected profit was 15 percent.

As an investment, the convertible preferred shares could be seen as either a fixed-income product with an upside kicker, or as an investment into a company’s equity with a solid downside protection in the form of an almost guaranteed fixed-income stream.

Putting aside, for a moment, the sensational news of hostile takeover offers and investments by white knight investors, how did Salomon look purely from the investment perspective in 1987? Taking a look at the 1986 annual report—the most recent that would have been available to investors at the time—the segmental reporting shows that the business at the time was divided into three main operating segments.

Securities, as shown here, was by far the largest operating segment. In the first part of the annual report, John Gutfreund discussed the business developments during the year and reveals that the securities segment was composed of numerous national entities in addition to the main U.S. business, including Salomon Brothers International Limited, based in London; Salomon Brothers AG, based in Frankfurt; and Salomon Brothers Asia Limited, in Tokyo. In terms of business activity, the report states that Salomon Securities focused on a combination of core investment banking activities like debt and equity underwriting along with trading/market making and research. The report notes that in 1986, Salomon managed or comanaged 764 corporate issues worth in excess of $100 billion in the U.S. capital markets. A total of 617 were U.S. corporate debt issues worth $86.2 billion, reflecting Salomon’s expertise in debt. A large portion of the remainder was related to equity issues, an area in which Salomon claimed to be gaining leadership.
In the report, Salomon emphasizes its expertise in market making and transaction handling, describing its execution of the largest trade in the history of the New York Stock Exchange—a 48.8 million share block trade of Navistar International Corporation, which totaled $488 million. Gutfreund also discusses the firm’s research capabilities, which were being strengthened internationally to focus on Japanese companies, in Tokyo, and on European equities, in London.
All in all, the annual report portrays the business as transaction based, with its reputation, people, and relationships as its key assets. As a potential investor in 1987, I would have concluded that Salomon was a well-run and global business, but nevertheless one without many structural advantages over its peers on Wall Street.
Salomon’s second and third businesses, both much smaller, are covered in less detail in the report. Commercial finance is described in the report as a business making short-term loans to mostly European and Asian clients including corporations, banks, governments, and financial institutions. Comparing 1986 with 1985, one sees that pretax earnings in this business declined by a small amount, from $182 million to $173 million.
The last business was called Phibro Energy. As the report details, Phibro Energy had actual refinery plants with a total refining capacity of more than 200,000 barrels per day. In fact, it operated as a full-spectrum oil refiner with the ability to serve a wide range of customer requests from crude oil to finished products. In addition to refining, Phibro also had a commodity trading business that conducted hedging, brokerage, and general trading of oil as well as nonoil commodities. The report reveals a severe contraction in the energy business from the year before, with pretax earnings dropping from $119 million in 1985 to $33 million in 1986. Gutfreund comments, however, that sequentially the fourth quarter showed some improvement over the third quarter and that he hoped that this business was on its way toward recovery.
Assessing the inherent business quality of the commercial finance and energy trading businesses, a potential investor would likely have considered them similar to the securities business. Commercial finance and energy trading had some advantage due to having larger networks than most peers, but to a large degree, their performance was based on good execution rather than structural advantages.
One must now look at Salomon’s financial statements. According to the selected financial data reproduced in
table 13.2
, Salomon increased its revenues five years in a row, from $2.9 billion in 1982 to $6.8 billion in 1986. This growth in size is matched by the growth in total assets carried by Salomon, which increased from $40 billion in 1982 to $78 billion in 1986. On the earnings front, however, there was much more volatility. While 1982 and 1983 were fairly good years, with net earnings margins above 11 percent and 15 percent, respectively, 1984 was a down year with a net earnings margin of only five percent. Return on equity (ROE) is another important metric to consider when assessing financial institutions; for this metric, Salomon earned greater than 20 percent in 1982 and 1983, but less than 10 percent in 1984. In 1986, the ROE was 16 percent. Given that the interest rate for 10-year government bonds was roughly seven to eight percent during that time, a 16 percent ROE is a fairly good performance.
Another metric useful for assessing financial businesses is return on assets (ROA). However, the balance sheet figures make it clear that many of Salomon’s assets were held in inventory for selling or passing on in investment banking transactions. Specifically, out of a total of $78.2 billion of Salomon assets, $42.5 billion related to bonds, equities, and commodities classified as inventories, and another $18.8 billion related to securities purchased under agreements to resell. Hence, ROA is not as helpful, as most of the assets held by Salomon were not expected to generate an investment return for the company. (I will discuss the ROA metric as well as ROE in more detail later when discussing Buffett’s investment in Wells Fargo.) In the case of Salomon, the main takeaway is that the business seemed to be foremost a people and transactional business. Net property, plant, and equipment account for only $311 million in total, and it is clear that the great profitability generated by the company is a result of the work its people have done. Once again, the report suggests that Salomon is a well-run business, but one that is heavily dependent on the skill of its business execution.

Note
: Revenues prior to 1986 have been restated to include commodity transactions on a gross profit basis. The 1984 earnings and return on average stockholders’ equity are after deducting special items amounting to $224 million after taxes ($1.55 and $1.45, respectively, for primary and fully diluted earnings per share), resulting primarily from a write-off of oil and gas properties and a restructuring of the nonenergy commodities business.
In terms of valuation, one can see from the Salomon annual report that Salomon’s stock ranged from $38 to $44 per share in the fourth quarter of 1986. By mid-1987, it was clear that the year would be a poor one for financial institutions in general. Salomon’s closing price on September 25, 1987—the Friday before Buffett’s purchase announcement—was $32 per share.
3
While there was obviously much volatility around the stock price (and in fact, like all other U.S. stocks, Salomon became significantly cheaper in October 1987 during Black Monday), the share price a potential investor would have seen in the first three quarters of 1987 would have roughly ranged between $30 and $40 per share.
Based on the $38 per share conversion feature of Buffett’s investment in Salomon, the valuation would have been as follows:

Since Salomon Inc. is a financial institution, the price/earnings ratio (PER) and price to book ratio (P/B) are crucial in assessing the value of the company. Enterprise value to earnings before interest and tax (EV/EBIT) is less relevant due to the inherent nature of financial debt and interest in this business.

Based on the historical 1986 net earnings, Salomon was trading at an 11.4 times multiple of net earnings. For a well-run business—but again, one with few inherent structural advantages—I would have found this to be a reasonably good value were I looking to invest at the time. If one considers a price of $30 per share, the PER based on 1986 full-year earnings would have been 9.0×. This would have been a very good value, if the ROE of 16 percent achieved in 1986 was representative of the business.
In P/B terms, the market capitalization was $5.9 billion based on the $38 share price. Given that the sharaeholders’ equity totaled $3.5 billion, the P/B for Salomon would have been 1.7×. Again, for a business that earns a 16 percent ROE, this is a fair price. A P/B of 1.4×, corresponding to a $30 share price, would of course have been more appealing.
In contemplating both the PER and P/B valuation, I would have considered the historical growth of Salomon, which had been significant on the revenue level but had been much less impressive on the earnings per share level. Along with the seemingly difficult business environment, I thus would have factored in only limited growth in assessing the fair valuation of Salomon. Given all this, had I been faced with investing in 1987, I would have been hesitant to invest at a $38 per share price but would possibly have invested at a $30 per share price. Note that in this hypothetical case, I am referring to the common equity of the company.
It seems to me that Buffett must have considered this investment foremost for its fixed income properties as preferred shares and only taken the equity potential for a well-run business in the framework of the convertible feature of those preferred shares. Looking for clues in Berkshire’s letter to shareholders, it seems that Buffett does indeed think of the Salomon investment first as a bond-like product, saying, “From most standpoints, this commitment fits into the medium-term, fixed-income securities category. In addition, we have an interesting conversion possibility.”
4
This investment in Salomon reflected a wider trend by Buffett of investing in companies through (convertible) preferred shares. This approach differed not only from the industry norm, but also from Buffett’s historical investments in common shares that defined his investing style up to this point. In his 1989 letter to shareholders, Buffett pointed out that although the convertible preferred shares did not match the returns possible when investing in businesses with wonderful economic prospects unappreciated by the market, he still expected these investments to achieve good returns above fixed-income portfolios. Moreover, these investments were in line with Buffett’s mentor Benjamin Graham’s idea that “A true investment must have two qualities—some degree of safety of principal and a satisfactory rate of return.”
5
Subsequent to Buffett’s investment, the Salomon investment case unfolded as a fascinating story of ups and downs. First came the stock market crash in October 1987, shortly after Buffett’s announcement to purchase Salomon. As first, Buffett had no significant cause for concern regarding his investment in Salomon. While the preferred shares seemed less likely to be converted through the equity conversion feature as stock prices plummeted, the fixed-income position would continue to guarantee a healthy dividend payout of nine percent per year. However, in the ensuing years, turmoil followed unexpectedly. In August 1991, Salomon announced that the company had violated U.S. Treasury rules regarding bond auctions and, as a result, top management resigned. What began as a submission of false bids by one rogue employee, Paul Mozer, ballooned into a cover-up by the management—up to and including Gutfreund. The situation became so dire that, at one point, the Treasury Department threatened to remove Salomon from its role as a primary dealer for government bonds. The saga is detailed in numerous books, including
Nightmare on Wall Street
by Martin Mayer, but the gist is that Salomon came very close to going under due to the pressures from the scandal. Several years later, Buffett took control of the company as interim chairman and restructured the entire business with integrity as the number one principle. In the end, Salomon was fined $290 million, and Gutfreund left the company. In 1997, the Travelers Group purchased the entirety of Salomon Brothers for $9 billion, and Buffett, after spending nine months running Salomon in 1991 and 1992, left to return to his normal responsibilities at Berkshire Hathaway. In 1998, Travelers Group merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup, an entity that still exists and includes what was the Salomon business.
Financially, the Salomon investment had been a huge hassle but was ultimately profitable for Berkshire. In addition to receiving the steady nine percent dividend until conversion, Buffett was able to exercise the conversion feature. Overall, this was perhaps a case where Buffett’s initial analysis, while probably sound, did not play out as expected. However, his deal structuring and his subsequent ability to influence the situation ultimately mitigated any financial losses he would have to suffer.
