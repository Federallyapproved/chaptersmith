1965: Berkshire Hathaway
By now, nearly everyone knows the name Berkshire Hathaway. But far fewer know about this company’s early history or the state the company was in when Warren Buffett began the process of purchasing it in 1962.
Figure 5.1.
The origins of Berkshire Hathaway were two New England textile manufacturing businesses dating back to the 1800s. Berkshire, formerly known as Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company, once spun as much as a quarter of the nation’s fine cotton. Hathaway Manufacturing, named after its founder Horatio Hathaway, was also involved with numerous textile products before specializing in parachute material manufacturing during World War II. Subsequently, Hathaway became the largest maker of rayon suits. In 1955, the two companies merged, creating the combined entity Berkshire Hathaway.
1
While Berkshire Hathaway was profitable during the postwar period, by the 1960s it was a shell of its former self. As Buffett comments in his annual letter to shareholders dated January 20, 1966 (the 1965 year-end annual letter), from an earnings figure before tax of $29.5 million in 1948, twelve mills, and 11,000 employees, the Berkshire Hathaway business had shrunk to marginal earnings, two mills, and 2,300 employees by 1965. Buffett attributed this to both the changing environment of the industry and a weak management that was unable to adapt to this change. Given these figures, an investor could surmise that this business was in a structural decline. The apparent reason was that cheaper imports of fabrics were coming in from abroad.
Nevertheless, as far as the inherent quality of the business, I have to say that this case is not quite as obvious as most people think nowadays. With the benefit of hindsight, it is very easy to dismiss the failure of Buffett to recognize or adequately account for the structural decline of Berkshire Hathaway. This is made easier by the fact that Buffett admitted in interviews that the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway was a mistake. But at the time, the picture would have been less clear. First, Berkshire Hathaway’s fabrics were sold to other clothing manufacturers as well as directly in retail channels in the form of curtains and other home furnishings. The latter, of course, were branded products.
As such, there certainly was the counterargument that Berkshire Hathaway was a premium segment product compared to the imports, and that while this might be a segment that was shrinking, there would still be a place for it. Moreover, as with any retail-related business, Berkshire Hathaway clearly was a business that could be influenced both positively and negatively by management decisions. One can see from Buffett’s letter that although this business was poorly managed for many years prior to 1965, it had recently put in place new management led by Ken Chace, whom Buffett deemed an excellent manager. It is not difficult to imagine that several factors indicated a rebound in the Berkshire Hathaway business.

Note
: Net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share of common stock for fiscal years ending 1961 through 1964 have been restated to give effect to a charge (credit) equivalent to federal income taxes. “Common shares outstanding” represents the total shares outstanding at the close of each fiscal year.
In fact, as we can see in
table 5.1
, the five-year financial summary published by Berkshire Hathaway

between 1962 and 1965, when Buffett made the bulk of his purchase into the company, the top line of the business would have appeared fairly stable—up one year and down another, rather than straight down. Keep in mind that by 1965 Buffett had already influenced a management change and put Ken Chace into the executive role, and Chace had already began to release value in a way reminiscent of Harry Boyle at Dempster Mill.
In any case, to summarize the business quality of Berkshire Hathaway from the viewpoint of an investor in 1965, it was clearly a business I would qualify as an “execution” business—one where execution is critical and one that does not have any inherent structural advantages over competitors. Still, it seemed to be a case where outstanding management may have worked something out. To a very astute investor, it would have been a very difficult case and likely much more positive than if one had just looked at the Berkshire business superficially in 1963 or 1964. However, the long-term risk of the business was there: revenues were in decline prior to 1960. A key question would have been to what degree the declines had been structurally driven rather than caused by poor management.
The second pillar of Buffett’s investment was clearly the valuation of the business. Buffett had purchased the stock of Berkshire Hathaway between 1962 and 1965 and for a price between $7.60 and $15 per share (the average price was $14.86).

Earnings Valuation
Assuming the stock price is at $14.06 per share, the average price at which Buffett accumulated his stake, the backward-looking EV/EBIT and price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) multiples would have appeared as the data shown in

We can see that, Berkshire Hathaway is a clear case where earnings instability at the operating level makes a fair assessment of multiples difficult. In fact, in the years immediately preceding 1964, Berkshire had made a negative EBIT. Still, an investor who had read the annual report in 1965 carefully, as Buffett surely did, would have realized that beneficial structural changes were occurring. As Ken Chace discusses in the section of the annual report titled “Review of Operations,” in 1965 the United States Congress passed legislation that “provides for the extension of one-price cotton through July 31, 1970, which enable American textile mills to continue to purchase American cotton at the same Government established price at which it is sold to foreign countries.” This was an extension of legislation first passed in 1964, which allowed U.S. mills to enjoy lower cotton costs at prices established by the government, and helped lower the cost of goods sold (COGS). If one puts together the effect of dramatically lower COGS, which is shown in the income statement in 1965, with the fact that the extension would guarantee some sort of fair pricing for cotton for the next five years, we can understand that this is very positive for Berkshire indeed. In light of this, if we assume a margin closer to that of 1965 and less of what appeared in 1964 and in prior years, the

EV/EBIT
based on 1965 EBIT looks very low. Even if sustainable margins were only 7.5 percent rather than the 9.5 percent achieved in 1965, there would be an EV/EBIT multiple of 3.0× based on stagnant top line.

In 1965, Ken Chace reported a net income and earnings per share (EPS) accounting for a tax rate of 47 percent. He did this to “prevent any misleading interpretation of future earnings when loss carryovers shall not be available.” These taxes were not real costs during 1965 and 1964, and in fact, as Berkshire still had loss carryovers of about $5 million at the end of 1965, they would not be real costs for at least another year or two. As such, I have included as reported and adjusted figures for the PER in
table 5.5
, with adjusted being the PER based on the actual real net income for Berkshire during the year.
In PER terms there is a similar situation as with EV/EBIT—very volatile earnings. Based on the same logic as before, the PER based on 1965 figures looks fairly cheap, although less so than the EV/EBIT, as Berkshire had a net cash position of $3.7 million ($3.62 per share).
The other important point is that based on real earnings, which I will discuss in the next section on asset valuation, the cash generation of the business is significantly better than indicated by reported net earnings.

As we can see, even before the share price is compared to book value per share, in 1965 Berkshire Hathaway had a positive cash flow of over $5 million. With this cash, it paid off $2.5 million in debt and built a portfolio of marketable securities of $2.9 million. A portion of this cash generation came from the net working capital, which Ken Chance clearly improved, but a large part came from the cash earnings, which as mentioned was much greater than reported earnings because the “tax” cost was not a real cost.
But what is really astounding here is that a business whose entire market capitalization was approximately $11.3 million generated a positive cash amount of $5.3 million in one year. It means that if Berkshire had two more years like this, even when not fully considering the net cash already present, an investor would get the entire business for free. This realization makes this opportunity look far more appealing than if one only examined the business fundamentals or earnings.

Taking the share price of $14.69 we, one can see that based on the balance sheet dated October 2, 1965, Berkshire Hathaway was also trading at a significant discount to its book value. In fact, it was trading at an over 20 percent discount to the value of just its net working capital plus the net cash it had in the form of cash and marketable securities.
As a last point, the PPE, which consisted of land, buildings, and machinery in the Berkshire business, has not been considered. This is because if we read the 1965 annual report carefully, we notice that on page five Ken Chace comments that a large part of the machinery at King Philip E. Division had been sold and that the remaining plant is to be disposed of during the coming year. While the sales would likely have been below their book value, they still would have been positive in terms of cash, indicating there was some value in here as well.
If we put all the information together, it seems quite clear what Buffett saw in the Berkshire Hathaway business. The combination of realizable value out of the book value with the very high cash generation of the business would make Berkshire Hathaway look very attractive to an analyst who examined the business in detail.
In his letters to shareholders dated November 1, 1965 and January 20, 1966, Buffett discusses the discount to book value for Berkshire Hathaway in some detail. He comments that net working capital (including net cash in my definition) alone was worth about $19 per share on December 31, 1965. He also comments that when calculating the fair value of BPL’s Berkshire Hathaway stake, he had valued the business at “a price halfway between net current asset and book value…[with] current assets at 100 cents on the dollar and our fixed assets at 50 cents on the dollar.” Basing the numbers from the balance sheet, this would imply that the fair value Buffett saw was around ½*($24.11) + ½*($18.48) = $ 21.30 per share. A share price of $14.69 would have implied a 31 percent discount to the fair value.
Clearly, this implies a margin of safety to asset values, and in a way this case is reminiscent of Dempster Mill and a Benjamin Graham type of net-net. However, it should be noted that in this case there is a clear indication that, especially in terms of cash earnings shown in 1965, the Berkshire Hathaway business had a significant ability to realize value on top of the existing asset value.
In summary, Berkshire Hathaway seems to have been a combination of asset value play as well as the potential for cash generation of the business. In 1965, when Buffett made the bulk of his purchase, the business had undergone several positive changes. First, regulatory changes would have been seen as a positive at the time for all fabric mills. Second and more important, a new capable management had just taken control. While the business was clearly in a difficult market with risks, without the benefit of hindsight, it would have seemed to be one where good management may be able to do something. In fact, in 1965 Buffett commented that “while a Berkshire is hardly going to be as profitable as a Xerox, Fairchild Camera or National Video in a hypertensed market, it is a very comfortable sort of thing to own.”
6
All things considered, it seems to me like a very sensible investment as a net-net type of investment at the time; it just was not one that worked out in the end.
With the benefit of hindsight, of course, the risks stemming from the market forces against American textile manufacturing would become too large for Berkshire to overcome by the 1980s. Buffett would later joke that in following the Graham perspective of investing in cigar butts, one tries to find a cigar butt for free that had one last puff in it, and Berkshire actually was a cigar butt that had no puffs left in it.
7
Still, it should be noted that while this investment is often identified as a “mistake” by Buffett, it likely did not actually lose money for Buffett in absolute terms. Given Berkshire Hathaway’s profitability in 1965 and certainly quite a few more years in the 1960s and 1970s, one should remember that the shrinking business actually provided the capital that Buffett invested in many other businesses starting in 1967 with the purchase of National Indemnity.
The lessons to be learned from the Berkshire Hathaway investment seem to come from looking at the long-term numbers. One lesson is to be very wary of a business that has had a ten-year decline in revenues or gross margins, even if the last two or three years have been positive. Those last few years may simply be the work of an outstanding management team when structural issues that even the best management team cannot overcome make life as an investor in the business very difficult in the long term. An additional lesson also seems to be that for net-net investments, businesses are not meant to be held long term. Hence, perhaps, purchasing the business was not the big mistake, but not selling it or making it a control situation rather than having an exit strategy was. In the previous net-net investments discussed (Sanborn Maps and Dempster Mill), Buffett had clear exit options within a few years of investing in the businesses. This was not the case with Berkshire Hathaway.
The famed history of Berkshire had its beginning here, and Buffett would get attached to this company, even revising his investment objectives a few years later to include holding companies that may not always deliver the best returns but also to have an altruistic regard for its employees.
To digress for a moment, looking at today’s business environment, there has been a similar structural attack in the retail sector in the last decade. But instead of foreign imports, this time the culprit is the Internet. As was the case with Borders, and to a lesser degree Barnes & Noble, the structural efficiency of the Internet model, apparent in companies such as Amazon, has wreaked havoc on the traditional business model of bricks and mortar book retailers. For Borders it has meant bankruptcy. Still, even the Internet has not affected all retail businesses in the same way. While its long-term success is still to be determined, Barnes & Noble’s effort to add cafes in its bookstores is helping the business differentiate its business model as a lifestyle destination of reading. More impressively, WHSmith, the UK equivalent, through a strategy of shifting its mix of stores toward travel locations, such as airports and train stations, and adding convenience product categories, such as packed lunches, drinks, and snacks, has transformed its business from a book retailer to a convenience retailer over the last decade. While books and magazines still account for more than 50 percent of shelf space (and a significant portion of sales), it is enlightening to know that the average purchase now at WHSmith is under £5 (approximately $7), suggesting that most purchases are impulse purchases. While the store still faces significant risk because approximately half of its stores are at nontravel locations, at least on the group level WHSmith has not only slowed but in fact increased its operating margins with this strategy over the last several years.
While I do not know how this story will play out, it goes to show that sometimes measures can be taken to overcome a structural decline, but other times nothing can be done. A careful analyst must be able to understand whether a particular case or investment situation is predictable or not.

Reflections on Buffett’s Partnership Years
Although I originally thought that Buffett focused primarily on cheap cigar-butt investments in his early partnership years, it is clear that, in reality, he was involved in many different types of investments. He neither invested exclusively in cheap Benjamin Graham–type cigar-butt opportunities nor did he focus only on great quality businesses. While Sanborn Maps and Dempster Mill were more of the former variety, American Express could only be categorized as the latter. In between, Buffett also invested in special situations, such as merger arbitrage in the case of Texas National Oil, and was willing to take control positions and catalyze change when he saw fit, as in the case of Dempster Mill. In fact, there is even a good indication that Buffett dabbled in long-short pair trades. In his annual letter to clients dated January 18, 1965, Buffett notes: “We have recently begun to implement a technique, which gives promise of very substantially reducing the risk from an overall change in valuation standards…[this was in reference to relatively undervalued companies].” While there was great diversity in the types of businesses in which Buffett invested in his partnership years, they shared some key commonalities. First, Buffett seemed to avoid situations where the business fundamentals were completely broken or deteriorating. Even in the cases of Sanborn Maps, Dempster Mill, and Berkshire, investments that were based primarily on the value of their assets rather than their earnings power (with the exception of Berkshire Hathaway where it was both), Buffett invested in companies when there was positive impetus in the business. Often, as in the case of Berkshire and Dempster Mill, there was a management change where a new capable manager replaced a poor previous management team in a business where execution mattered. In the three cases of Sanborn Maps, Dempster Mill, and Berkshire, Buffett also identified clear operational improvement opportunities, where a positive catalyst could be expected. Most important, in all the cases analyzed Buffett appeared to invest only in businesses that were still profitable. In the case of Dempster Mill, although the company was barely making a profit, it was still generating one. Buffett avoided companies that were quickly burning cash. I find this an important lesson because companies that trade below asset values, while not frequent, are not rare. However, many of these companies are burning cash, and it can be dangerous to be convinced of such turnaround stories, where if a turnaround does not happen, one loses one’s whole investment. That risk is much lower with companies that are still profitable and have some positive impetus.
Second, Buffett conducted thorough primary research on each business he invested in. This research included a detailed understanding of how the businesses functioned fundamentally, which I would have suspected before examining these cases more closely. But it also included a thorough understanding of both the management and ownership structures to a level of detail that I found astounding. In the case of Sanborn Maps, Buffett knew the exact constellation of the board of managers, and even what their thinking was as pertained to Sanborn. In the case of Berkshire, Buffett knew intimately both the management team as well as the owners he was buying from.
Third, for businesses where there was more than one main business activity, most prominently in the example of American Express, Buffett clearly strived to understand the individual economics of the sub-businesses rather than viewing the business based on financials as a group. Because of this, he likely saw in the case of American Express a quickly growing credit card business that was only temporarily hampered by operational issues and that already showed clear signs of recovery and growth in 1963. He also likely saw that Dempster Mill was not simply a deteriorating windmill business. What this reveals is that investors should be careful not to focus only on financial metrics. Such metrics are reported for a group level and often are not as useful to an investor as understanding the core functions of businesses and how these functions might impact the financial developments of the company.
Allow me to draw an analogy between Buffett’s research into his investments and the current investment universe in Europe. I recently visited a media company in the UK, the Daily Mail General Trust (DMGT). Although it was originally a newspaper company, namely the family-run Daily Mail group of newspapers, since the late 1990s DMGT has been accumulating a group of business-to-business (B2B) subscription-based businesses. As of fiscal year 2012, this set of B2B businesses now accounts for roughly 50 percent of revenues and over 70 percent of EBIT. The remaining 50 percent of revenues and about 30 percent EBIT still come from the original paper business, which for simplicity I will call the B2C (retail) business.
8
Without looking too deeply at the fundamental business economics of the B2C business and the B2B business, what an investor would see in the last ten years based on group financials is stagnating revenues and profit margin. According to DMGT’s group financials, it had revenue of GBP 1.96 billion and an EBIT of 192 million (EBIT margin of 9.8 percent) in FY 2001. In FY 2011A, the corresponding revenue was GBP 1.99 billion with an EBIT of 213.4 million (EBIT margin of 10.7 percent).
Based on the financials alone, an investor could easily conclude that the business had not changed much—that in aggregate it was stagnant. However, this is far from the truth. If an investor were to delve into the fundamental business economics of the two sub-businesses, that investor would see that the B2B business, for example, has much lighter capital intensity than the newspaper business and much higher operating margins. What this means is that the newspaper business is shrinking in size, and the B2B business is growing. The need for replacement capital expenditure is much lower than the level of depreciation that DMGT as a group charges, leading to much higher cash generation than ordinarily warranted by the stagnant level of earnings. In the total group figures the numbers are not necessarily easy to see due to layers of exceptional and restructuring costs related to winding down some of the newspaper businesses, but if one focuses on understanding the separate businesses and their inherent characteristics, I believe it is much easier to see. And in the end, the higher level of cash generation, which continues to increase, is critical because that is what an investor is paying for.
Overall, regarding Buffett’s assessment of the DMGT case, I find that if an investor does not delve into sub-businesses like Buffett must have done, one will miss many aspects of an investment case that may be central to one’s investment strategy.
Part II
The Middle Years (1968–1990)
Between 1968 and 1990, Warren Buffett moves away from his investment partnership and guides Berkshire Hathaway as his new investment vehicle. Increasingly, he invests in private companies and builds up his asset base in insurance, regional banks, and other
control assets
such as Nebraska Furniture Mart and See’s Candies. Fundamentally, we also see Buffett gradually shift focus from investing in stocks that appeared cheap compared to their asset values to incorporating more qualitative factors when selecting his investments.
The economic context of the years between 1968 and 1990 was complex. The end of the 1960s was characterized by booming stock markets and few value opportunities. It was in fact because of this economic environment that Buffett closed his partnership in 1968. In 1969, the market finally broke into the first of a sequence of market crashes that continued for several years. The 1970s were tough years for the stock market, with the markets ending the decade with the S&P 500 at around the same level at which it had started. In the interim, there were two major economic recessions: one in 1974, which included one of the largest stock market crashes of recent times, and another in 1979. Inflation also became rampant in the late 1970s with interest rates shooting up to 15 percent by the end of the decade.
The 1980s was then the decade when inflation was brought under control through policies implemented by Paul Volker. Soon to follow were the proliferation of company debt and the rise of junk bonds and corporate takeovers. Large blue chip companies were not safe with business people like Ivan Boseky acting in financial markets. However, after a brief recession in 1982, a long period of economic prosperity and stability in the financial markets began, which lasted until 2000.
