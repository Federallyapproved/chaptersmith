- Which of the following is a true statement about ARP poisoning or MAC spoofing? MAC spoofing is used to overload the memory of a switch. ARP poisoning is used to falsify the physical address of a system to impersonate that of another authorized device. MAC spoofing relies on ICMP communications to traverse routers. ARP poisoning can use unsolicited or gratuitous replies.

- An organization stores group project data files on a central SAN. Many projects have numerous files in common but are organized into separate project containers. A member of the incident response team is attempting to recover files from the SAN after a malware infection. However, many files are unable to be recovered. What is the most likely cause of this issue? Using Fibre Channel Performing real-time backups Using file encryption Deduplication

- Using Fibre Channel

- Performing real-time backups

- Jim was tricked into clicking on a malicious link contained in a spam email message. This caused malware to be installed on his system. The malware initiated a MAC flooding attack.
