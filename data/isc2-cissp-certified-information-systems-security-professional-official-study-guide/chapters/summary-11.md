## Summary

The tasks of designing, deploying, and maintaining security on a network require intimate knowledge of the technologies involved in networking. This includes protocols, services, communication mechanisms, topologies, cabling, endpoints, and networking devices.

The OSI model is a standard against which all protocols are evaluated. Understanding how the OSI model is used and how it applies to real-world protocols can help system designers and system administrators improve security. The TCP/IP model is derived directly from the protocol and roughly maps to the OSI model.

Most networks employ TCP/IP as the primary protocol. IP networking includes IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the version of Internet Protocol that is most widely used around the world. IPv6 is being rapidly adopted for both private and public network use. DNS and ARP were developed to interchange or resolve between domain names and IP addresses or IP addresses and MAC addresses, respectively. TCP/IP supports many secure protocols, including IPsec, SSH, and protocols encrypted by TLS. TCP/IP is a multilayer protocol suite that allows for flexibility, resiliency, and encryption.

Converged protocols are common on modern networks, including FCoE, MPLS, VoIP, and iSCSI. SDN and CDN have expanded the definition of network as well as expanded the use cases for it.

Microsegmentation divides an internal network into numerous subzones to allow for greater security and control of communications, which in turn supports a zero trust security policy.

Wireless communications occur in many forms, including cell phone, Bluetooth (802.15), RFID, NFC, and networking (802.11). Wireless communication is more vulnerable to interference, eavesdropping, denial of service, and on-path attacks.

Routers, hubs, switches, repeaters, gateways, proxies, NAC, and firewalls are an important part of a network's security. Firewalls are essential tools in managing, controlling, and filtering network traffic. Endpoint security is the concept that each individual device must maintain local security whether or not its network or telecommunications channels also provide security.

A wide range of hardware components can be used to construct a network, not the least of which is the cabling used to tie all the devices together. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each transmission media type is part of designing a secure network.
