## The Nature of Disaster

Disaster recovery planning brings order to the chaos that surrounds the interruption of an organization's normal activities. By its very nature, a disaster recovery plan is designed to cover situations where tensions are already high and cooler heads may not naturally prevail. Picture the circumstances in which you might find it necessary to implement DRP measures—a hurricane destroys your main operations facility; a fire devastates your main processing center; terrorist activity closes off access to a major metropolitan area. Any event that stops, prevents, or interrupts an organization's ability to perform its work tasks (or threatens to do so) is considered a disaster. The moment that IT becomes unable to support mission-critical processes is the moment DRP kicks in to manage the restoration and recovery procedures.

A disaster recovery plan should be set up so that it can almost run on autopilot. The DRP should also be designed to reduce decision making activities during a disaster as much as possible. Essential personnel should be well trained in their duties and responsibilities in the wake of a disaster and also know the steps they need to take to get the organization up and running as soon as possible. We'll begin by analyzing some of the possible disasters that might strike your organization and the particular threats that they pose. Many of these are mentioned in Chapter 3 , but we'll now explore them in further detail.

To plan for natural and unnatural disasters in the workplace, you must first understand their various forms, as explained in the following sections.

### Natural Disasters

Natural disasters reflect the occasional fury of our habitat—violent occurrences that result from changes in the earth's surface or atmosphere that are beyond human control. In some cases, such as hurricanes, scientists have developed sophisticated predictive models that provide ample warning before a disaster strikes. Others, such as earthquakes, can cause devastation at a moment's notice. A disaster recovery plan should provide mechanisms for responding to both types of disasters, either with a gradual buildup of response forces or as an immediate reaction to a rapidly emerging crisis.

#### Earthquakes

Earthquakes are caused by the shifting of seismic plates and can occur almost anywhere in the world without warning. However, they are far more likely to occur along known fault lines that exist in many areas of the world. A well-known example is the San Andreas Fault, which poses a significant risk to portions of the western United States. If you live in a region along a fault line where earthquakes are likely, your DRP should address the procedures your business will implement should a seismic event interrupt your normal activities.

You might be surprised by some of the regions of the world where earthquakes are considered possible. The U.S. Geological Survey considers the following states to have the highest earthquake hazard risk:

- Alaska

- Arkansas

- California

- Hawaii

- Idaho

- Illinois

- Kentucky

- Missouri

- Montana

- Nevada

- Oregon

- South Carolina

- Tennessee

- Utah

- Washington

- Wyoming

However, it is extremely important to recognize that seismic risk is not uniform across a state. Figure 18.1 provides a more granular seismic risk map. If you examine this map, you'll discover that some areas in these high-risk states actually have very low localized risk, whereas there are areas in almost every state where earthquake risk is significant.

#### Floods

Flooding can occur almost anywhere in the world at any time of the year. Some flooding results from the gradual accumulation of rainwater in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water that then overflow their banks and flood the community. Other floods, known as flash floods , strike when a sudden severe storm dumps more rainwater on an area than the ground can absorb in a short period of time. Floods can also occur when dams are breached. Large waves caused by seismic activity, or tsunamis , combine the awesome power and weight of water with flooding, as we saw during the 2011 tsunami in Japan. This tsunami amply demonstrated the enormous destructive capabilities of water and the havoc it can wreak on various businesses and economies when it triggered an unprecedented nuclear disaster at Fukushima.

According to government statistics, flooding is responsible for approximately $8 billion (that's billion with a b !) in damage to businesses and homes each year in the United States. It's important that your DRP make appropriate response plans for the eventuality that a flood may strike your facilities.

When you evaluate a firm's risk of damage from flooding to develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans, it's also a good idea to check with responsible individuals and ensure that your organization has sufficient insurance in place to protect it from the financial impact of a flood. In the United States, most general business policies do not cover flood damage, and you should investigate obtaining specialized government-backed flood insurance under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program. Outside the U.S., commercial insurance providers may offer these policies.

Although flooding is theoretically possible in almost any region of the world, it is much more likely to occur in certain areas. FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is responsible for completing a flood risk assessment for the entire United States and providing this data to citizens in graphical form. You can view flood maps at msc.fema.gov/portal .

This site also provides valuable information on recorded earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, and other natural disasters to help you prepare your organization's risk assessment.

Figure 18.2 shows a flood map for a portion of the downtown region of Miami, Florida. When viewing flood maps, like the example shown in Figure 18 . 2 , you'll find that they often combine several different types of confusing terminology. First, the shading indicates the likelihood of a flood occurring in an area. Areas shaded with the darkest color are described as falling within the 100-year floodplain . This means that the government estimates the chance of flooding in that area are 1 in 100, or 1.0 percent. Those shaded more lightly lie within the 500-year floodplain , meaning that there is a 1 in 500, or 0.2 percent annual risk of flood.

These maps also contain information about the impact of a flood, measured in terms of the depth of flooding expected during a flooding event. Those are described as zones having many different letter codes, which you will not need to memorize for the CISSP exam.

#### Storms

Storms come in many forms and pose diverse risks to a business. Prolonged periods of intense rainfall bring the risk of flash flooding, as described in the previous section. Hurricanes and tornadoes come with the threat of winds exceeding 100 miles per hour that undermine the structural integrity of buildings and turn everyday objects such as trees, lawn furniture, and even vehicles into deadly missiles. Hailstorms bring a rapid onslaught of destructive ice chunks falling from the sky. Many storms also bring the risk of lightning, which can cause severe damage to sensitive electronic components. For this reason, your business continuity plan should detail appropriate mechanisms to protect against lightning-induced damage, and your disaster recovery plan should include adequate provisions for power outages and equipment damage that might result from a lightning strike. Never underestimate the damage that a single storm can do.

In 2017, the Category 4 Atlantic hurricane Harvey marked one of the costliest, deadliest, and strongest hurricanes ever to make landfall in the continental United States. It bored a path of destruction through Texas, destroying both natural and human-made features. The total economic impact stemming from the damage Harvey caused is estimated at more than $125 billion, and it directly resulted in at least 63 deaths. Storm damage continues to result in devastating costs, partially driven by inflation in building costs and partially driven by climate change. In 2020, an active hurricane season was estimated as causing over $46 billion in damage.

If you live in an area susceptible to a certain type of severe storm, it's important to regularly monitor weather forecasts from responsible government agencies. For example, disaster recovery specialists in hurricane-prone areas should periodically check the website of the National Weather Service's National Hurricane Center ( nhc.noaa.gov ) during hurricane season. This website allows you to monitor Atlantic and Pacific storms that may pose a risk to your region before word about them hits the local news. This knowledge lets you begin a gradual and proactive response to the storm before time runs out.

#### Fires

Fires can start for a variety of reasons, both natural and human-made, but both forms can be equally devastating. During the BCP/DRP process, you should evaluate the risk of fire and implement at least basic measures to mitigate that risk and prepare the business for recovery from a catastrophic fire in a critical facility.

Some regions of the world are susceptible to wildfires during the warm season. These fires, once started, spread in somewhat predictable patterns, and fire experts working with meteorologists can produce relatively accurate forecasts of a wildfire's potential path. It is important, of course, to remember that wildfires can behave unpredictably and require constant vigilance. In 2018, the Camp Fire in California destroyed the town of Paradise within 4 hours of ignition.

The damage caused by forest fires continues to increase, driven by climate change. In 2020, the state of California experienced over 9,600 fires burning over 4.3 million acres of the state. To put that in context, 4 percent of the land area of the state of California burned in a single year.

As with many other types of large-scale natural disasters, you can obtain valuable information about impending threats on the web. In the United States, the National Interagency Fire Center posts daily fire updates and forecasts on its website: www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm . Other countries have similar warning systems in place.

#### Pandemics

Pandemics pose a significant health and safety risk to society and have the potential to disrupt business operations in a manner unlike many other disasters. Rather than causing physical damage, pandemics threaten the safety of individuals and prevent them from gathering in large numbers, shutting down offices and other facilities.

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 was the most severe example to occur in the past century, but numerous other smaller outbreaks have occurred, including the SARS outbreak, avian flu, and swine flu. Major outbreaks like COVID-19 may be infrequent, but the severity of this risk requires careful planning, including building contingency plans for how businesses will operate in a pandemic response mode and what types of insurance may or may not provide coverage in response to a pandemic.

#### Other Natural Events

Some regions of the world are prone to localized types of natural disasters. During the BCP/DRP process, your assessment team should analyze all of your organization's operating locations and gauge the impact that such events might have on your business. For example, many parts of the world are subject to volcanic eruptions. If you conduct operations in an area in close proximity to an active or dormant volcano, your DRP should probably address this eventuality. Other localized natural occurrences include monsoons in Asia, tsunamis in the South Pacific, avalanches in mountainous regions, and mudslides in the western United States.

If your business is geographically diverse, it is prudent to include local emergency response experts on your planning team. At the very least, make use of local resources such as government emergency preparedness teams, civil defense organizations, and insurance claim offices to help guide your efforts. These organizations possess a wealth of knowledge and are usually more than happy to help you prepare your organization for the unexpected—after all, every organization that successfully weathers a natural disaster is one less organization that requires a portion of their valuable recovery resources after disaster strikes.

### Human-Made Disasters

Our advanced civilization has become increasingly dependent on complex interactions between technological, logistical, and natural systems. The same complex interactions that make our sophisticated society possible also present a number of potential vulnerabilities from both intentional and unintentional human-made disasters . In the following sections, we'll examine a few of the more common disasters to help you analyze your organization's vulnerabilities when preparing a business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan.

#### Fires

Earlier in the chapter, we explained how some regions of the world are susceptible to wildfires during the warm season, and these types of fires can be described as natural disasters. Many smaller-scale fires result from human action—be it carelessness, faulty electrical wiring, improper fire protection practices, arson, or other reasons. Studies from the Insurance Information Institute indicate that there are at least 1,000 building fires in the United States every day . If such a fire strikes your organization, do you have the proper preventive measures in place to quickly contain it? If the fire destroys your facilities, how quickly does your disaster recovery plan allow you to resume operations elsewhere?

#### Acts of Terrorism

Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, businesses are increasingly concerned about risks posed by terrorist threats. These attacks caused many small businesses to fail because they did not have business continuity/disaster recovery plans in place that were adequate to ensure their continued viability. Many larger businesses experienced significant losses that caused severe long-term damage. The Insurance Information Institute issued a study one year after the attacks that estimated the total damage from the attacks in New York City at $40 billion (yes, that's with a b again!).

General business insurance may not properly cover an organization against acts of terrorism. In years past, most policies either covered acts of terrorism or didn't mention them explicitly. After suffering catastrophic terrorism-related losses, many insurance companies responded by amending policies to exclude losses from terrorist activity. Policy riders and endorsements are sometimes available, but often at extremely high cost. If your business continuity or disaster recovery plan includes insurance as a means of financial recovery (as it probably should!), you'd be well advised to check your policies and contact your insurance professionals to ensure that you're still covered.

Terrorist acts pose a unique challenge to DRP teams because of their unpredictable nature. Prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, few DRP teams considered the threat of an airplane crashing into their corporate headquarters significant enough to merit mitigation. Many companies are asking themselves a number of “what if” questions regarding terrorist activity. In general, these questions are healthy because they promote dialogue between business elements regarding potential threats. On the other hand, disaster recovery planners must emphasize solid risk-management principles and ensure that resources aren't overallocated to terrorist threats to the detriment of other DRP/BCP activities that protect against more likely threats.

#### Bombings/Explosions

Explosions can result from a variety of human-made occurrences. Explosive gases from leaks might fill a room/building and later ignite and cause a damaging blast. In many areas, bombings are also cause for concern. From a disaster planning perspective, the effects of bombings and explosions are like those caused by a large-scale fire. However, planning to avoid the impact of a bombing is much more difficult and relies on the physical security measures we cover in Chapter 10 , “Physical Security Requirements.”

#### Power Outages

Even the most basic disaster recovery plan contains provisions to deal with the threat of a short power outage. Critical business systems are often protected by uninterruptible power supply (UPS) devices to keep them running at least long enough to shut down or long enough to get emergency generators up and working. Even so, could your organization keep operating during a sustained power outage?

After Hurricane Harvey made landfall in 2017, millions of people in Texas lost power. Similar power outages occurred in 2020 in response to the California wildfires. Does your business continuity plan include provisions to keep your business viable during a prolonged period without power? If so, what is your planning horizon? Do you need enough fuel and other supplies to last for 48 hours? Seven days? Does your disaster recovery plan make ample preparations for the timely restoration of power even if the commercial power grid remains unavailable? All of these decisions should be made based on the requirements in your business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

Check your UPSs regularly! These critical devices are often overlooked until they become necessary. Many UPSs contain self-testing mechanisms that report problems automatically, but it's still a good idea to subject them to regular testing. Also, be sure to audit the number and type of devices plugged into each UPS. It's amazing how many people think it's okay to add “just one more system” to a UPS, and you don't want to be surprised when the device can't handle the load during a real power outage!

Today's technology-driven organizations depend increasingly on electric power, so your BCP/DRP team should consider provisioning alternative power sources that can run business systems for an extended period of time. An adequate backup generator could make a huge difference when the survival of your business is at stake.

#### Network, Utility, and Infrastructure Failures

When planners consider the impact that utility outages may have on their organizations, they naturally think first about the impact of a power outage. However, keep other utilities in mind, too. Do any of your critical business systems rely on water, sewers, natural gas, or other utilities? Also consider regional infrastructure such as highways, airports, and railroads. Any of these systems can suffer failures that might not be related to weather or other conditions described in this chapter. Many businesses depend on one or more of these infrastructure elements to move people or materials. Their failure can paralyze your business's ability to continue functioning.

You must also think about your internet connectivity as a utility service. Do you have sufficient redundancy in your connectivity options to survive or recover quickly from a disaster? If you have redundant providers, do they have any single points of failure? For example, do they both enter your building in a single fiber conduit that could be severed? If there are no alternative fiber ingress points, can you supplement a fiber connection with wireless connectivity? Do your alternate processing sites have sufficient network capacity to carry the full burden of operations in the event of a disaster?

If you quickly answered “no” to the question whether you have critical business systems that rely on water, sewers, natural gas, or other utilities, think again. Do you consider people a critical business system? If a major storm knocks out the water supply to your facilities and you need to keep those facilities up and running, can you supply your employees with enough drinking water to meet their needs?

What about your fire protection systems? If any of them are water based, is there a holding tank system in place that contains ample water to extinguish a serious building fire if the public water system is unavailable? Fires often cause serious damage in areas ravaged by storms, earthquakes, and other disasters that might also interrupt the delivery of water.

#### Hardware/Software Failures

Like it or not, computer systems fail. Hardware components simply wear out and refuse to continue performing, or they suffer physical damage. Software systems contain bugs or fall prey to improper or unexpected inputs. For this reason, BCP/DRP teams must provide adequate redundancy in their systems. If zero downtime is a mandatory requirement, one solution is to use fully redundant failover servers in separate locations attached to separate communications links and infrastructures (also designed to operate in a failover mode). If one server is damaged or destroyed, the other will instantly take over the processing load. For more information on this concept, see the section “Remote Mirroring,” later in this chapter.

Because of financial constraints, it isn't always feasible to maintain fully redundant systems. In those circumstances, the BCP/DRP team should address how replacement parts can be quickly obtained and installed. As many parts as possible should be kept in a local parts inventory for quick replacement; this is especially true for hard-to-find parts that must otherwise be shipped in. After all, how many organizations could do without telephones for three days while a critical private branch exchange (PBX) component is en route from an overseas location to be installed on site?

### Real World Scenario

### NYC Blackout

On August 14, 2003, the lights went out in New York City and in large areas of the northeastern and midwestern United States when a series of cascading failures caused the collapse of a major power grid.

Fortunately, security professionals in the New York area were ready. Many businesses had already updated their disaster recovery plans and took steps to ensure their continued operations in the wake of a disaster. This blackout served to test those plans, and many organizations were able to continue operating on alternate power sources or to transfer control seamlessly to offsite data-processing centers.

Although this blackout occurred at the turn of the century, the lessons learned still offer insight for BCP/DRP teams around the world today. The most recent infrastructure failure of colossal magnitude. The lessons we continue to take away today include the following:

- Ensure that alternate processing sites are far enough away from your main site that they are unlikely to be affected by the same disaster.

- Remember that threats to your organization are both internal and external. Your next disaster may come from a terrorist attack, a building fire, or malicious code running loose on your network. Take steps to ensure that your alternate sites are segregated from the main facility to protect against all of these threats.

- Disasters don't usually come with advance warning. If real-time operations are critical to your organization, be sure that your backup sites are ready to assume primary status at a moment's notice.

#### Strikes/Picketing

When designing your business continuity and disaster recovery plans, don't forget about the importance of the human factor in emergency planning. One form of human-made disaster that is often overlooked is the possibility of a strike or other labor crisis. If a large number of your employees walk out at the same time, what impact would that have on your business? How long would you be able to sustain operations without the regular full-time employees that staff a certain area? Your BCP and DRP teams should address these concerns and provide alternative plans should a labor crisis occur. Labor issues normally fall outside the purview of cybersecurity teams, offering a great example of an issue that should be included in a disaster recovery plan but requires input and leadership from other business functions, such as human resources and operations.

#### Theft/Vandalism

Earlier, we talked about the threat that terrorist activities pose to an organization. Theft and vandalism represent the same kind of threat on a much smaller scale. In most cases, however, there's a far greater chance that your organization will be affected by theft or vandalism than by a terrorist attack. The theft or destruction of a critical infrastructure component, such as scrappers stealing copper wires or vandals destroying sensors, can negatively impact critical business functions.

Insurance provides some financial protection against these events (subject to deductibles and limitations of coverage), but acts of this kind can cause serious damage to your business, on both a short-term and a long-term basis. Your business continuity and disaster recovery plans should include adequate preventive measures to control the frequency of these occurrences as well as contingency plans to mitigate the effects theft and vandalism have on ongoing operations.

Theft of infrastructure is becoming increasingly common as scrappers target copper in air-conditioning systems, plumbing, and power subsystems. It's a common mistake to assume that fixed infrastructure is unlikely to be a theft target.

### Real World Scenario

### Offsite Challenges to Security

The constant threat of theft and vandalism is the bane of information security professionals worldwide. Personally identifiable information, proprietary or trade secrets, and other forms of confidential data are just as interesting to those who create and possess them as they are to direct competitors and other unauthorized parties. Here's an example.

Aaron knows the threats to confidential data firsthand, working as a security officer for a prominent and highly visible computing enterprise. His chief responsibility is to keep sensitive information from exposure to various elements and entities. Bethany is one of his more troublesome employees because she's constantly taking her notebook computer off site without properly securing its contents.

Even a casual smash-and-grab theft attempt could put thousands of client contacts and their confidential business dealings at risk of being leaked and possibly sold to malicious parties. Aaron knows the potential dangers, but Bethany just doesn't seem to care.

This poses the question: How might you better inform, train, or advise Bethany so that Aaron does not have to relieve her of her position should her notebook be stolen? Bethany must come to understand and appreciate the importance of keeping sensitive information secure. It may be necessary to emphasize the potential loss and exposure that comes with losing such data to wrongdoers, competitors, or other unauthorized third parties. It may suffice to point out to Bethany that the employee handbook clearly states that employees whose behavior leads to the unauthorized disclosure or loss of information assets are subject to loss of pay or termination. If such behavior recurs after a warning, Bethany should be rebuked and reassigned to a position where she can't expose sensitive or proprietary information—that is, if she's not fired on the spot.

Keep in mind the impact that theft may have on your operations when planning your parts inventory. It's a good idea to keep extra inventory of items with a high pilferage rate, such as RAM chips and mobile devices. It's also a good idea to keep such materials in secure storage and to require employees to sign such items out whenever they are used.
