## Internet of Things

Smart devices are a range of devices that offer the user a plethora of customization options, typically through installing apps, and may take advantage of on-device or in-the-cloud machine learning (ML) processing. The products that can be labeled “smart devices” are constantly expanding and already include smartphones, tablets, music players, home assistants, extreme sport cameras, virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems, and fitness trackers.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a class of smart devices that are internet-connected in order to provide automation, remote control, or AI processing to appliances or devices. IoT may often perform functions and operate similar to an embedded system, but they are different. An IoT device is almost always a separate and distinct hardware device that is used on its own or in conjunction with an existing system (such as a smart IoT thermostat for a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning [HVAC] system). An embedded system is one where the computer control component has been integrated into the structure, design, and operation of the larger mechanism, often even built into the same chassis or case.

The security issues related to IoT are often about access and encryption. All too often an IoT device was not designed with security as a core concept or even an afterthought. This has resulted in numerous home and office network security breaches. Additionally, once an attacker has remote access to or through an IoT device, they may be able to access other devices on the compromised network. When electing to install IoT equipment, evaluate the security of the device as well as the security reputation of the vendor. If the device does not have the ability to meet or accept your existing security baseline, then don't compromise your security just for a flashy gadget.

One possible secure implementation is to deploy a distinct network for the IoT equipment, which is kept separate and isolated from the primary network. This configuration is often known as three dumb routers (see www.grc.com/sn/sn-545.pdf or www.pcper.com/reviews/General-Tech/Steve-Gibsons-Three-Router-Solution-IOT-Insecurity ). Other standard security practices are beneficial to IoT, including keeping systems patched, limiting physical and logical access, monitoring all activity, and implementing firewalls and filtering.

Wearable technology or wearables are offshoots of smart devices and IoT devices that are specifically designed to be worn by an individual. The most common examples of wearable technology are smart watches and fitness trackers. There are an astounding number of available options, with a wide range of features and security capabilities. When selecting a wearable device, consider the security implications. Is the data being collected in a cloud service that is secured for private use or is it made publicly available? What alternative uses is the collected data going to be used for? Is the communication between the device and the collection service encrypted? And can you delete your data and profile from the service completely if you stop using the device?

Although we often associate smart devices and IoT with home or personal use, they are also a concern to every organization. This is partly because of the use of mobile devices by employees within the company's facilities and even on the organizational network.

Another concern is that many IoT or networked automation devices are often used in the business environment. This includes environmental controls, such as HVAC management, air quality control, debris and smoke detection, lighting controls, door automation, personnel and asset tracking, and consumable inventory management and auto-reordering (such as coffee, snacks, printer toner, paper, and other office supplies). Thus, both smart devices and IoT devices are potential elements of a modern business network that need appropriate security management and oversight. For some additional reading on the importance of proper security management of smart devices and IoT equipment, see “NIST Initiatives in IoT” at www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nist-initiatives-iot .

A common IoT device deployed in a business environment is sensors. Sensors can measure just about anything, including temperature, humidity, light levels, dust particles, movement, acceleration, and air/liquid flow. Sensors can be linked with cyber-physical systems to automatically adjust or alter operations based on the sensor's measurements, such as turning on the air conditioning when the temperature rises above a threshold. Sensors can also be linked to ICS, DCS, and SCADA solutions.

The precautions related to facility automation devices are the same as for smart devices, IoT, and wearables. Always consider the security implications, evaluate the included or lacking security features, consider implementing the devices in an isolated network away from your other computer equipment, and only use solutions that provide robust authentication and encryption.

Often IoT devices—in fact, almost all hardware and software—will have insecure or weak defaults. Never assume defaults are good enough. Always evaluate the setting and configuration options of acquired IoT products and make changes that optimize security and support business functions. This is especially relevant to default passwords, which must always be changed and verified.

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a derivative of IoT that focuses more on industrial, engineering, manufacturing, or infrastructure level oversight, automation, management, and sensing. IIoT is an evolution of ICS and DCS that integrates cloud services to perform data collection, analysis, optimization, and automation. Examples of IIoT include edge computing and fog computing (see the section “Edge and Fog Computing,” earlier in this chapter).
