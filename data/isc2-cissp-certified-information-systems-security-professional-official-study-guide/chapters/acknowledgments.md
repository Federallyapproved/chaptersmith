# Acknowledgments

We'd like to express our thanks to Wiley for continuing to support this project. Extra thanks to the development editor, Kelly Talbot, and technical editors, Jerry Rayome, Chris Crayton, and Aaron Kraus, who performed amazing feats in guiding us to improve this book. Thanks as well to our agent, Carole Jelen, for continuing to assist in nailing down these projects.

—Mike, James, and Darril

Special thanks go to my many friends and colleagues in the cybersecurity community who provided hours of interesting conversation and debate on security issues that inspired and informed much of the material in this book.

I would like to thank the team at Wiley, who provided invaluable assistance throughout the book development process. I also owe a debt of gratitude to my literary agent, Carole Jelen of Waterside Productions. My coauthors, James Michael Stewart and Darril Gibson, were great collaborators and I'd like to thank them both for their thoughtful contributions to my chapters.

I'd also like to thank the many people who participated in the production of this book but whom I never had the chance to meet: the graphics team, the production staff, and all of those involved in bringing this book to press.

—Mike Chapple

Thanks to Mike Chapple and Darril Gibson for continuing to contribute to this project. Thanks also to all my CISSP course students who have provided their insight and input to improve my training courseware and ultimately this tome. To my adoring wife, Cathy: Building a life and a family together has been more wonderful than I could have ever imagined. To Slayde and Remi: You are growing up so fast and learning at an outstanding pace, and you continue to delight and impress me daily. You are both growing into amazing individuals. To my mom, Johnnie: It is wonderful to have you close by. To Mark: No matter how much time has passed or how little we see each other, I have been and always will be your friend. And finally, as always, to Elvis: You were way ahead of the current bacon obsession with your peanut butter/banana/bacon sandwich; I think that's proof you traveled through time!

—James Michael Stewart

It's been a pleasure working with talented people like James Michael Stewart and Mike Chapple. Thanks to both of you for all your work and collaborative efforts on this project. The technical editors, Jerry Rayome, Chris Crayton, and Aaron Kraus, provided us with some outstanding feedback, and this book is better because of their efforts. Thanks to the team at Wiley (including project managers, editors, and graphic artists) for all the work you did helping us get this book to print. Last, thanks to my wife, Nimfa, for putting up with my odd hours as I worked on this book.

—Darril Gibson
