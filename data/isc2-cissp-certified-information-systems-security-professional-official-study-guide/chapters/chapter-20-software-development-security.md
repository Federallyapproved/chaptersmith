## Chapter 20: Software Development Security

- A. The three elements of the DevOps model are software development, quality assurance, and IT operations. Information security is only introduced in the DevSecOps model.

- B. Input validation ensures that the input provided by users matches the design parameters. Polyinstantiation includes additional records in a database for presentation to users with differing security levels as a defense against inference attacks. Contamination is the mixing of data from a higher classification level and/or need-to-know requirement with data from a lower classification level and/or need-to-know requirement. Screening is a generic term and does not represent any specific security technique in this context.

- C. Request control provides users with a framework to request changes and developers with the opportunity to prioritize those requests. Configuration control ensures that changes to software versions are made in accordance with the change and configuration management policies. Request control provides an organized framework for users to request modifications. Change auditing is used to ensure that the production environment is consistent with the change accounting records.

- C. In a fail-secure state, the system remains in a high level of security until an administrator intervenes. In a fail-open state, the system defaults to a low level of security, disabling controls until the failure is resolved. Failure mitigation seeks to reduce the impact of a failure. Fail clear is not a valid approach.

- B. The iterative waterfall model uses a seven-stage approach to software development and includes a feedback loop that allows development to return to the previous phase to correct defects discovered during the subsequent phase.

- B. The activities of threat assessment, threat modeling, and security requirements are all part of the Design function under SAMM.

- C. Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity constraints between tables that participate in a relationship. Candidate keys are sets of fields that may potentially serve as the primary key, the key used to uniquely identify database records. Alternate keys are candidate keys that are not selected as the primary key.

- D. In this case, the process the database user is taking advantage of is aggregation. Aggregation attacks involve the use of specialized database functions to combine information from a large number of database records to reveal information that may be more sensitive than the information in individual records would reveal. Inference attacks use deductive reasoning to reach conclusions from existing data. Contamination is the mixing of data from a higher classification level and/or need-to-know requirement with data from a lower classification level and/or need-to-know requirement. Polyinstantiation is the creation of different database records for users of differing security levels.

- C. Polyinstantiation allows the insertion of multiple records that appear to have the same primary key values into a database at different classification levels. Aggregation attacks involve the use of specialized database functions to combine information from a large number of database records to reveal information that may be more sensitive than the information in individual records would reveal. Inference attacks use deductive reasoning to reach conclusions from existing data. Manipulation is the authorized or unauthorized alteration of data in a database.

- D. In Agile, the highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. It is not to prioritize security over other requirements. The Agile principles also include satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery, businesspeople and developers working together, and paying continuous attention to technical excellence.

- C. Expert systems use a knowledge base consisting of a series of “if/then” statements to form decisions based on the previous experience of human experts.

- D. In the Managed phase, level 4 of the SW-CMM, the organization uses quantitative measures to gain a detailed understanding of the development process.

- B. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) acts as a proxy between applications and the back-end DBMS. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a model for the software development process that incorporates all necessary activities. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a regulatory framework for credit card processing. Abstraction is a software development concept that generalizes common behaviors of software objects into more abstract classes.

- A. In order to conduct a static test, the tester must have access to the underlying source code. Black-box testing does not require access to source code. Dynamic testing is an example of black-box testing. Cross-site scripting is a specific type of vulnerability, and it may be discovered using both static and dynamic techniques, with or without access to the source code.

- A. A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that shows the interrelationships over time between projects and schedules. It provides a graphical illustration of a schedule that helps to plan, coordinate, and track specific tasks in a project. A PERT chart focuses on the interrelationships between tasks rather than the specific details of the schedule. Bar charts are used to present data, and Venn diagrams are used to show the relationships between sets.

- C. Contamination is the mixing of data from a higher classification level and/or need-to-know requirement with data from a lower classification level and/or need-to-know requirement. Aggregation attacks involve the use of specialized database functions to combine information from a large number of database records to reveal information that may be more sensitive than the information in individual records would reveal. Inference attacks use deductive reasoning to reach conclusions from existing data. Polyinstantiation includes additional records in a database for presentation to users with differing security levels as a defense against inference attacks.

- D. Tonya is purchasing the software, so it is not open source. It is used widely in her industry, so it is not custom developed for her organization. There is no indication in the question that the software is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The best answer here is commercial-off-the-shelf software (COTS).

- C. Configuration audit is part of the configuration management process rather than the change control process. Request control, release control, and change control are all components of the configuration management process.

- C. The isolation principle states that two transactions operating on the same data must be temporarily separated from each other so that one does not interfere with the other. The atomicity principle says that if any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back. The consistency principle says that the database must always be in a state that complies with the database model's rules. The durability principle says that transactions committed to the database must be preserved.

- B. The cardinality of a table refers to the number of rows in the table, whereas the degree of a table is the number of columns. In this case, the table has three columns (name, telephone number, and customer ID), so it has a degree of three.
