## Chapter 10: Physical Security Requirements

- A fence is an excellent perimeter safeguard that can help to deter casual trespassing. Moderately secure installations work when the fence is 6 to 8 feet tall and will typically be cyclone (also known as chain link) fencing with the upper surface twisted or barbed to deter casual climbers. More secure installations usually opt for fence heights over 8 feet and often include multiple strands of barbed or razor wire strung above the chain link fabric to further deter climbers.

- Halon is an effective fire suppression compound (it starves a fire of oxygen by disrupting the chemical reaction of combustion), but it degrades into toxic gases at 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, it is not environmentally friendly (it is an ozone-depleting substance). The 1989 Montreal Protocol initiated the termination of manufacturing of ozone-depleting substances, which includes halon. In 1994, the EPA banned the manufacture of halon in the United States as well as importing halon into the country. However, according to the Montreal Protocol, you can obtain halon by contacting a halon recycling facility. The EPA seeks to exhaust existing stocks of halon to take this substance out of circulation, although even in 2020 there are still significant domestic stockpiles of halon.

- Any time water is used to respond to fire, flame, or smoke, water damage becomes a serious concern, particularly when water is released in areas where electrical equipment is in use. Not only can computers and other electrical gear be damaged or destroyed by water, but also many forms of storage media can become damaged or unusable. Also, when seeking hot spots to put out, firefighters often use axes to break down doors or cut through walls to reach them as quickly as possible. This, too, poses the potential for physical damage to or destruction of devices and/or wiring that may also be in the vicinity.

- Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a well-established school of thought on “secure architecture.” The idea is to structure the physical environment and surroundings to influence individual decisions that potential offenders make before committing any criminal acts. CPTED addresses facility design, landscaping, entrance concepts, campus layouts, light, road placement, and traffic management of vehicles and those on foot. The core principle of CPTED is that the design of the physical environment can be managed, manipulated, and crafted with intention in order to create behavioral effects or changes in people present in those areas that result in reduction of crime as well as a reduction of the fear of crime. CPTED has three main strategies: natural access control, natural surveillance, and natural territorial reinforcement.

- A proximity device can be a passive device, a field-powered device, or a transponder. The proximity device is worn or held by the authorized bearer. When it passes near a proximity reader, the reader device is able to determine who the bearer is and whether they have authorized access. The passive proximity device has no active electronics; it is just a small magnet with specific properties (like antitheft devices commonly found in or on retail product packaging). A passive device reflects or otherwise alters the electromagnetic (EM) field generated by the reader device. This alteration is detected by the reader device, which triggers the alarm, records a log event, or sends a notification. A field-powered proximity device has electronics that activate when the device enters the EM field that the reader generates. Such devices actually generate electricity from an EM field to power themselves (such as card readers that require only that the access card be waved within inches of the reader to unlock doors). This is effectively the concept of radio-frequency identification (RFID). A transponder proximity device is self-powered and transmits a signal received by the reader. This can occur consistently or only at the press of a button (like a garage door opener or car alarm key fob). Such devices may have batteries, capacitors, or even be solar powered.
