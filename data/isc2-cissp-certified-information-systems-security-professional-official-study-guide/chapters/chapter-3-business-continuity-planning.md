## Chapter 3: Business Continuity Planning

- B. As the first step of the process, the business organization analysis helps guide the remainder of the work. James and his core team should conduct this analysis and use the results to aid in the selection of team members and the design of the BCP process.

- C. This question requires that you exercise some judgment, as do many questions on the CISSP exam. All of these answers are plausible things that Tracy could bring up, but we're looking for the best answer. In this case, that is ensuring that the organization is ready for an emergencyâ€”a mission-critical goal. Telling managers that the exercise is already scheduled or required by policy doesn't address their concerns that it is a waste of time. Telling them that it won't be time-consuming is not likely to be an effective argument because they are already raising concerns about the amount of time requested.

- C. A firm's officers and directors are legally bound to exercise due diligence in conducting their activities. This concept creates a fiduciary responsibility on their part to ensure that adequate business continuity plans are in place. This is an element of corporate responsibility, but that term is vague and not commonly used to describe a board's responsibilities. Disaster requirement and going concern responsibilities are also not risk management terms.

- D. During the planning phase, the most significant resource utilization will be the time dedicated by members of the BCP team to the planning process. This represents a significant use of business resources and is another reason that buy-in from senior management is essential.

- A. The quantitative portion of the priority identification should assign asset values in monetary units. The organization may also choose to assign other values to assets, but non-monetary measures should be part of a qualitative, rather than a quantitative, assessment.

- C. The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) represents the amount of money a business expects to lose to a given risk each year. This figure is quite useful when performing a quantitative prioritization of business continuity resource allocation.

- C. The maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) represents the longest period a business function can be unavailable before causing irreparable harm to the business. This figure is useful when determining the level of business continuity resources to assign to a particular function.

- B. The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the product of the asset value (AV) and the exposure factor (EF). From the scenario, you know that the AV is $3 million and the EF is 90 percent; based on that the same land can be used to rebuild the facility. This yields an SLE of $2,700,000.

- D. This problem requires you to compute the annualized loss expectancy (ALE), which is the product of the single loss expectancy (SLE) and the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). From the scenario, you know that the ARO is 0.05 (or 5 percent). From question 8, you know that the SLE is $2,700,000. This yields an ALE of $135,000.

- A. This problem requires you to compute the ALE, which is the product of the SLE and the ARO. From the scenario, you know that the ARO is 0.10 (or 10 percent). From the scenario presented, you know that the SLE is $7.5 million. This yields an ALE of $750,000.

- C. Risk mitigation controls to address acceptable risks would not be in the BCP. The risk acceptance documentation should contain a thorough review of the risks facing the organization, including the determination as to which risks should be considered acceptable and unacceptable. For acceptable risks, the documentation should include a rationale for that decision and a list of potential future events that might warrant a reconsideration of that determination. The documentation should include a list of controls used to mitigate unacceptable risks, but it would not include controls used to mitigate acceptable risks, since acceptable risks do not require mitigation.

- D. The safety of human life must always be the paramount concern in business continuity planning. Be sure that your plan reflects this priority, especially in the written documentation that is disseminated to your organization's employees!

- C. It is difficult to put a dollar figure on the business lost because of negative publicity. Therefore, this type of concern is better evaluated through a qualitative analysis. The other items listed here are all more easily quantifiable.

- B. The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the amount of damage that would be caused by a single occurrence of the risk. In this case, the SLE is $10 million, the expected damage from one tornado. The fact that a tornado occurs only once every 100 years is not reflected in the SLE but would be reflected in the annualized loss expectancy (ALE).

- C. The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is computed by taking the product of the single loss expectancy (SLE), which was $10 million in this scenario, and the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO), which was 0.01 in this example. These figures yield an ALE of $100,000.

- C. In the provisions and processes phase, the BCP team designs the procedures and mechanisms to mitigate risks that were deemed unacceptable during the strategy development phase.

- D. This is an example of alternative systems. Redundant communications circuits provide backup links that may be used when the primary circuits are unavailable.

- C. Disaster recovery plans pick up where business continuity plans leave off. After a disaster strikes and the business is interrupted, the disaster recovery plan guides response teams in their efforts to quickly restore business operations to normal levels.

- A. The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the likelihood that the risk will materialize in any given year. The fact that a power outage did not occur in any of the past three years doesn't change the probability that one will occur in the upcoming year. Unless other circumstances have changed, the ARO should remain the same.

- C. You should strive to have the highest-ranking person possible sign the BCP's statement of importance. Of the choices given, the chief executive officer (CEO) has the highest ranking.
