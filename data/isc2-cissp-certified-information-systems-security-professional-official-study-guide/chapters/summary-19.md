## Summary

Information security professionals must be familiar with the investigation process. This involves gathering and analyzing the evidence required to conduct an investigation. Security professionals should be familiar with the major categories of evidence, including real evidence, documentary evidence, and testimonial evidence. Electronic evidence is often gathered through the analysis of hardware, software, storage media, and networks. It is essential to gather evidence using appropriate procedures that do not alter the original evidence and preserve the chain of custody.

Computer crimes are grouped into several major categories, and the crimes in each category share common motivations and desired results. Understanding what an attacker is after can help in properly securing a system.

For example, military and intelligence attacks are launched to acquire secret information that could not be obtained legally. Business attacks are similar except that they target civilian systems. Other types of attacks include financial attacks and terrorist attacks (which, in the context of computer crimes, are attacks designed to disrupt normal life). There are also grudge attacks, the purpose of which is to cause damage by destroying data or using information to embarrass an organization or person, and thrill attacks, launched by inexperienced crackers to compromise or disable a system. Although generally not sophisticated, thrill attacks can be annoying and costly. Finally, hacktivists take their potentially sophisticated skills and apply them to issues where they have a political interest.

The set of rules that govern your personal behavior is a code of ethics. There are several codes of ethics, from general to specific in nature, that security professionals can use to guide them. The (ISC) 2 makes the acceptance of its Code of Ethics a requirement for certification.
