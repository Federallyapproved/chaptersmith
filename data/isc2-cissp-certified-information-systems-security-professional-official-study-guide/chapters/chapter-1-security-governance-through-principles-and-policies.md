## Chapter 1: Security Governance Through Principles and Policies

- C. Hardware destruction is a violation of availability and possibly integrity. Violations of confidentiality include stealing passwords, eavesdropping, and social engineering.

- B. The primary goals and objectives of security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, commonly referred to as the CIA Triad. The other options are incorrect. A security infrastructure needs to establish a network's border perimeter security, but that is not a primary goal or objective of security. AAA services is a common component of secured systems, which can provide support for accountability, but the primary goals of security remain the elements of the CIA Triad. Ensuring that subject activities are recorded is the purpose of auditing, but that is not a primary goal or objective of security.

- B. Availability means that authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects. Identification is claiming an identity, the first step of AAA services. Encryption is protecting the confidentiality of data by converting plain text into cipher text. Layering is the use of multiple security mechanisms in series.

- D. Security governance seeks to compare the security processes and infrastructure used within the organization with knowledge and insight obtained from external sources. The other statements are not related to security governance. Authorization ensures that the requested activity or access to an object is possible given the rights and privileges assigned to the authenticated identity. Abstraction is used for efficiency. Similar elements are put into groups, classes, or roles that are assigned security controls, restrictions, or permissions as a collective. COBIT is a documented set of best IT security practices crafted by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) that prescribes goals and requirements for security controls and encourages the mapping of IT security ideals to business objectives.

- C. A strategic plan is a long-term plan that is fairly stable. It defines the organization's security purpose. It defines the security function and aligns it to the goals, mission, and objectives of the organization. The tactical plan is a midterm plan developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan or can be crafted ad hoc based on unpredicted events. An operational plan is a short-term, highly detailed plan based on the strategic and tactical plans. It is valid or useful only for a short time. A rollback plan is a means to return to a prior state after a change does not meet expectations.

- A, C, D, F. Acquisitions and mergers place an organization at an increased level of risk. Such risks include inappropriate information disclosure, data loss, downtime, and failure to achieve sufficient return on investment (ROI). Increased worker compliance is not a risk, but a desired security precaution against the risks of acquisitions. Additional insight into the motivations of inside attackers is not a risk, but a potential result of investigating breaches or incidents related to acquisitions.

- A. Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) was initially crafted by the British government for domestic use but is now an international standard, which is a set of recommended best practices for core IT security and operational processes, and is often used as a starting point for the crafting of a customized IT security solution. The other options were not crafted by the British government. ISO 27000 is a family group of international standards that can be the basis of implementing organizational security and related management practices. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides OS, application, and hardware security configuration guides. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is designed for critical infrastructure and commercial organizations and consists of five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. It is a prescription of operational activities that are to be performed on an ongoing basis for the support and improvement of security over time.

- B. The security professional has the functional responsibility for security, including writing the security policy and implementing it. Senior management is ultimately responsible for the security maintained by an organization and should be most concerned about the protection of its assets. The custodian role is assigned to the user who is responsible for the tasks of implementing the prescribed protection defined by the security policy and senior management. An auditor is responsible for reviewing and verifying that the security policy is properly implemented and the derived security solutions are adequate.

- A, B, C, E. The COBIT key principles are: Provide Stakeholder Value (C), Holistic Approach (A), Dynamic Governance System (E), Governance Distinct From Management (not listed), Tailored to Enterprise Needs (not listed), and End-to-End Governance System (B). The concept of maintaining authenticity and accountability are good security ideas, but not a COBIT key principle.

- A, D. Due diligence is establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of an organization. Due care is practicing the individual activities that maintain the security effort. The other options are incorrect, they have the terms inverted. The corrected statements are as follows: Due diligence is developing a formalized security structure containing a security policy, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures. Due care is the continued application of a security structure onto the IT infrastructure of an organization. Due diligence is knowing what should be done and planning for it. Due care is doing the right action at the right time.

- B. A policy is a document that defines the scope of security needed by the organization and discusses the assets that require protection and the extent to which security solutions should go to provide the necessary protection. A standard defines compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology, and security controls. A procedure is a detailed, step-by-step how-to document that describes the exact actions necessary to implement a specific security mechanism, control, or solution. A guideline offers recommendations on how security requirements are implemented and serves as an operational guide for both security professionals and users. III is the definition of a baseline, which was not included as a component option.

- D. When confidential documents are exposed to unauthorized entities, this is described by the I in STRIDE, which represents information disclosure. The elements of STRIDE are spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.

- B. This scenario describes a proactive approach to threat modeling, which is also known as the defensive approach. A reactive approach or adversarial approach to threat modeling takes place after a product has been created and deployed. There is no threat modeling concept known as qualitative approach. Qualitative is typically associated with a form of risk assessment.

- A, B, D. These statements are true: (A) Each link in the supply chain should be responsible and accountable to the next link in the chain; (B) Commodity vendors are unlikely to have mined their own metals or processed the oil for plastics or etched the silicon of their chips; and (D) Failing to properly secure a supply chain can result in flawed or less reliable products, or even embedded listing or remote control mechanisms. The remaining option is incorrect. Even if a final product seems reasonable and performs all necessary functions, that does not provide assurance that it is secure or that it was not tampered with somewhere in the supply chain.

- D. Though not explicitly stating hardware, this scenario describes a typical and potential risk of a supply chain, that a hardware risk results in the presence of a listening mechanism in the final product. This scenario does not provide information that would indicate that the supply chain risk is focused on software, services, or data.

- B. In this scenario, Cathy should void the authorization to operate (ATO) of this vendor. This situation describes the fact that the vendor is not meeting minimal security requirements which are necessary to the protection of the service and its customers. Writing a report is not a sufficient response to this discovery. You may have assumed Cathy does or does not have the authority to perform any of the other options, but there is no indication of Cathy's position in the organization. It is reasonable for a CEO to ask the CISO to perform such an evaluation. Regardless, the report should be submitted to the CISO, not the CIO, whose focus is primarily on ensuring that information is used effectively to accomplish business objectives, not that such use is secure. Reviewing terms and conditions will not make any difference in this scenario, as those typically apply to customers, not internal operations. And reviewing does not necessarily cause a change or improvement to insecure practices. A vendor-signed NDA has no bearing on this scenario.

- A. Minimum security requirements should be modeled on your existing security policy. This is based on the idea that when working with a third party, that third party should have at least the same security as your organization. A third-party audit is when a third-party auditor is brought in to perform an unbiased review of an entity's security infrastructure. This audit may reveal where there are problems, but the audit should not be the basis of minimum security requirements for a third party. On-site assessment is when you visit the site of the organization to interview personnel and observe their operating habits. This is not the basis for establishing minimum security requirements for a third party. Vulnerability scan results, like third-party audits, may reveal concerns, but it is not the basis for establishing minimum security requirements for a third party.

- C. Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a seven-stage threat modeling methodology. PASTA is a risk-centric approach that aims at selecting or developing countermeasures in relation to the value of the assets to be protected. Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) is a threat modeling concept that integrates threat and risk management into an Agile programming environment on a scalable basis. Microsoft uses a Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) with the motto “Secure by Design, Secure by Default, Secure in Deployment and Communication” (also known as SD3+C). STRIDE is a threat categorization scheme developed by Microsoft.

- B, C, E, F, G. The five key concepts of decomposition are trust boundaries, dataflow paths, input points, privileged operations, and details about security stance and approach. Patch or update version management is an important part of security management in general; it is just not a specific component of decomposition. Determining open vs. closed source code use is not an element of decomposition.

- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. All of the listed options are terms that relate to or are based on defense in depth: layering, classifications, zones, realms, compartments, silos, segmentations, lattice structure, and protection rings.
