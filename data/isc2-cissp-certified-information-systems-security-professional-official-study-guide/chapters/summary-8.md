## Summary

Secure systems are not just assembled; they are designed to support security. Systems that must be secure are judged for their ability to support and enforce the security policy. Programmers should strive to build security into every application they develop, with greater levels of security provided to critical applications and those that process sensitive information.

There are numerous issues related to the establishment and integration of security into a product, including managing subjects and objects and their relationships, using open or closed systems, managing secure defaults, designing a system to fail securely, abiding by the “keep it simple” postulate, implementing zero trust (instead of trust but verify), and incorporating privacy by design. CIA can be protected using confinement, bounds, and isolation. Controls are used to implement security protections.

Proper security concepts, controls, and mechanisms must be integrated before and during the design and architectural period in order to produce a reliably secure product. A trusted system is one in which all protection mechanisms work together to process sensitive data for many types of users while maintaining a stable and secure computing environment. In other words, trust is the presence of a security mechanism or capability. Assurance is the degree of confidence in satisfaction of security needs. In other words, assurance is how reliable the security mechanisms are at providing security.

When security systems are designed, it is often helpful to derive security mechanisms from standard security models. Some of the security models that should be recognized include the trusted computing base, state machine model, information flow model, noninterference model, take-grant model, access control matrix, Bell–LaPadula model, Biba model, Clark–Wilson model, Brewer and Nash model, Goguen–Meseguer model, Sutherland model, Graham–Denning model, and Harrison–Ruzzo–Ullman model.

Several security criteria exist for evaluating computer security systems. The Common Criteria uses a subjective system to meet security needs and a standard Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) to evaluate reliability.

The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) establishes an Authorization to Operate (ATO) issued by an Authorizing Official (AO) in order to ensure that only systems with acceptable risk levels are used to perform IT operations.

It is important to carefully assess each aspect of the infrastructure to ensure that it sufficiently supports security. Without an understanding of the security capabilities of information systems, it is impossible to evaluate them, nor is it possible to implement them properly. The security capabilities of information systems include memory protection, virtualization, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), encryption/decryption, interfaces, and fault tolerance.
