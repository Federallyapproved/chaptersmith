## Review Questions

- While designing the security for the organization, you realize the importance of not only balancing the objectives of the organization against security goals but also focusing on the shared responsibility of security. Which of the following is considered an element of shared responsibility? (Choose all that apply.) Everyone in an organization has some level of security responsibility. Always consider the threat to both tangible and intangible assets. Organizations are responsible to their stakeholders for making good security decisions in order to sustain the organization. When working with third parties, especially with cloud providers, each entity needs to understand their portion of the shared responsibility of performing work operations and maintaining security. Multiple layers of security are required to protect against adversary attempts to gain access to internal sensitive resources. As we become aware of new vulnerabilities and threats, we should consider it our responsibility (if not our duty) to responsibly disclose that information to the proper vendor or to an information sharing center.

- Your organization is considering the deployment of a DCE to support a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) based on the characters of a popular movie franchise.

- Your boss wants to automate the control of the building's HVAC system and lighting in order to reduce costs. He instructs you to keep costs low and use off-the-shelf IoT equipment. When you are using IoT equipment in a private environment, what is the best way to reduce risk? Use public IP addresses Power off devices when not in use Keep devices current on updates Block access from the IoT devices to the internet

- Use public IP addresses

- Power off devices when not in use

- Keep devices current on updates

- Block access from the IoT devices to the internet

- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) constructs new applications or functions out of existing but separate and distinct software services. The resulting application is often new; thus, its security issues are unknown, untested, and unprotected. Which of the following is a direct extension of SOA that creates single-use functions that can be employed via an API by other software? Cyber-physical systems Fog computing DCS Microservices

- Cyber-physical systems

- Fog computing

- DCS

- Microservices

- A new local VDI has been deployed in the organization. There have been numerous breaches of security due to issues on typical desktop workstations and laptop computers used as endpoints. Many of these issues stemmed from users installing unapproved software or altering the configuration of essential security tools. In an effort to avoid security compromises originating from endpoints in the future, all endpoint devices are now used exclusively as dumb terminals. Thus, no local data storage or application execution is performed on endpoints. Within the VDI, each worker has been assigned a VM containing all of their business necessary software and datasets. These VMs are configured to block the installation and execution of new software code, data files cannot be exported to the actual endpoints, and each time a worker logs out, the used VM is discarded and a clean version copied from a static snapshot replaces it. What type of system has now been deployed for the workers to use? Cloud services Nonpersistent Thin clients Fog computing

- Cloud services

- Nonpersistent

- Thin clients

- Fog computing

- A review of your company's virtualization of operations determines that the hardware resources supporting the VMs are nearly fully consumed. The auditor asks for the plan and layout of VM systems but is told that no such plan exists. This reveals that the company is suffering from what issue? Use of EOSL systems VM sprawl Poor cryptography VM escaping

- Use of EOSL systems

- VM sprawl

- Poor cryptography
