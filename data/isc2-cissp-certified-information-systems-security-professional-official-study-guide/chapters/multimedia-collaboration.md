## Multimedia Collaboration

Multimedia collaboration is the use of various multimedia-supporting communication solutions to enhance distance collaboration (people working on a project together remotely). Often, collaboration allows workers to work simultaneously as well as across different time frames. Collaboration can also be used for tracking changes and including multimedia functions. Collaboration can incorporate email, chat, VoIP, videoconferencing, use of a whiteboard, online document editing, real-time file exchange, versioning control, and other tools. It is often a feature of advanced forms of remote meeting technology.

Whatever SaaS service is implemented to support multimedia collaboration, it is essential that it be thoroughly reviewed against the organization's security policy. Just because someone is working remotely does not mean that security should be relaxed. It is important to verify that connections are encrypted, that robust multifactor authentication is in use, and that tracking is available for the hosting organization to review.

### Remote Meeting

Remote meeting technology is used for any product, hardware, or software that allows for interaction between remote parties. These technologies and solutions are known by many other terms: digital collaboration, virtual meetings, videoconferencing, software or application collaboration, shared whiteboard services, virtual training solutions, and so on. Any service that enables people to communicate, exchange data, collaborate on materials/data/ documents, and otherwise perform work tasks together can be considered a remote meeting technology service.

No matter what form of multimedia collaboration is implemented, the attendant security implications must be evaluated. There are many questions about security that need to be asked and satisfactory answers uncovered prior to deployment or use:

- Does the service use strong authentication techniques?

- Does the communication occur across an open protocol or an encrypted tunnel?

- Is the encryption just from endpoint to central server or is it end-to-end?

- Does the solution allow for true deletion of content?

- Are activities of users audited and logged?

- Can unauthorized entities join in a private meeting?

- Can attendees interject into the meeting with voice, image, video, or file sharing?

- Does the platform integrate advertising/spam into the interface and can it be disabled?

- What tracking mechanisms are used, can the tracking be disabled, and what is the data collected for?

- Are sessions recorded? Who has access to the recordings? Can they be exported and distributed?

Multimedia collaboration and other forms of remote meeting technology can improve the work environment and allow for input from a wider range of diverse workers across the globe, but this is a benefit only if the security of the communications solution can be ensured and personnel are trained to use it effectively and in compliance with company policy.

### Instant Messaging and Chat

Instant messaging (IM) , real-time messaging, or chat is a mechanism that allows for real-time text-based chat between two or more people located anywhere on the internet. Some IM utilities allow for file transfer, multimedia, voice and videoconferencing, and more. Some forms of IM are based on a peer-to-peer service whereas others use a centralized controlling server. Peer-to-peer-based IM and cloud-based IM systems are easy for end users to deploy and use, but it's difficult to manage from a corporate perspective because it may lack security or management controls. Messaging systems and chat services usually have numerous vulnerabilities, such as being susceptible to packet sniffing/eavesdropping, lacking native security capabilities such as multifactor authentication and encryption, and providing little or no protection for privacy.

Many standalone chat clients have been susceptible to malicious code deposit or infection through their file transfer capabilities. Also, chat users are often subject to numerous forms of social engineering attacks, such as impersonation or convincing a victim to reveal information that should remain confidential (such as passwords, PII, or intellectual property).

There are several modern text communication solutions for both person-to-person interactions and collaboration and communications among a group. Some are public services, such as Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and Snapchat. Others are designed for private or internal use, such as Slack, Discord, Line, Telegram, WeChat, Signal, WhatsApp, Google Chat, Cisco Spark, Zoom, Workplace by Facebook, Microsoft Teams, and Skype. Most of these messaging services are designed with security as a key feature, often employing multifactor authentication and transmission encryption.
