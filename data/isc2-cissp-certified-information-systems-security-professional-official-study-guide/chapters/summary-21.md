## Summary

Applications developers have a lot to worry about! Hackers are always becoming more sophisticated in their tools and techniques. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs, and other malicious code exploit vulnerabilities in applications and operating systems or use social engineering to infect systems and gain access to their resources and confidential information. Ransomware combines malware with encryption technology to deny users access to their data until they pay a substantial ransom.

Applications themselves also may contain a number of vulnerabilities. Buffer overflow attacks exploit code that lacks proper input validation to affect the contents of a system's memory. Backdoors provide former developers and malicious code authors with the ability to bypass normal authentication mechanisms. Rootkits provide attackers with an easy way to conduct privilege escalation attacks.

Many applications are moving to the web, creating a new level of exposure and vulnerability. Cross-site scripting attacks allow hackers to trick users into providing sensitive information to unsecure sites. SQL injection attacks allow the bypassing of application controls to directly access and manipulate the underlying database.
