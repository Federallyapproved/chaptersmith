## Chapter 7: PKI and Cryptographic Applications

- D. Any change, no matter how minor, to a message will result in a completely different hash value. There is no relationship between the significance of the change in the message and the significance of the change in the hash value.

- B. Side-channel attacks use information gathered about a system's use of resources, timing, or other characteristics to contribute to breaking the security of encryption. Brute-force attacks seek to exhaust all possible encryption keys. Known plaintext attacks require access to both plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext. Frequency analysis attacks require access to ciphertext.

- C. Richard must encrypt the message using Sue's public key so that Sue can decrypt it using her private key. If he encrypted the message with his own public key, the recipient would need to know Richard's private key to decrypt the message. If he encrypted it with his own private key, any user could decrypt the message using Richard's freely available public key. Richard could not encrypt the message using Sue's private key because he does not have access to it. If he did, any user could decrypt it using Sue's freely available public key.

- C. The major disadvantage of the ElGamal cryptosystem is that it doubles the length of any message it encrypts. Therefore, a 2,048-bit plaintext message would yield a 4,096-bit ciphertext message when ElGamal is used for the encryption process.

- A. The elliptic curve cryptosystem requires significantly shorter keys to achieve encryption that would be the same strength as encryption achieved with the RSA encryption algorithm. A 3,072-bit RSA key is cryptographically equivalent to a 256-bit elliptic curve cryptosystem key.

- B. The SHA-2 hashing algorithm comes in four variants. SHA-224 produces 224-bit digests. SHA-256 produces 256-bit digests. SHA-384 produces 384-bit digests, and SHA-512 produces 512-bit digests. Of the options presented here, only 512 bits is a valid SHA-2 hash length.

- D. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is deprecated and no longer considered secure. It should never be used. The Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3), Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2, and IPsec are all modern, secure protocols and standards.

- A. Cryptographic salt values are added to the passwords in password files before hashing to defeat rainbow table and dictionary attacks. Double hashing does not provide any added security. Adding encryption to the passwords is challenging, because then the operating system must possess the decryption key. A one-time pad is only appropriate for use in human-to-human communications and would not be practical here.

- B. Sue would have encrypted the message using Richard's public key. Therefore, Richard needs to use the complementary key in the key pair, his private key, to decrypt the message.

- B. Richard should encrypt the message digest with his own private key. When Sue receives the message, she will decrypt the digest with Richard's public key and then compute the digest herself. If the two digests match, she can be assured that the message truly originated from Richard.

- C. The Digital Signature Standard allows federal government use of the Digital Signature Algorithm, RSA, or the Elliptic Curve DSA in conjunction with the SHA-1 hashing function to produce secure digital signatures.

- B. X.509 governs digital certificates and the public key infrastructure (PKI). It defines the appropriate content for a digital certificate and the processes used by certificate authorities to generate and revoke certificates.

- B. Fault injection attacks compromise the integrity of a cryptographic device by causing some type of external fault, such as the application of high-voltage electricity. Implementation attacks rely on flaws in the cryptographic algorithm. Timing attacks measure the length of time consumed by encryption operations. Chosen ciphertext attacks require access to the algorithm and work by having the attacker perform encryption that results in an expected ciphertext.

- C. HTTPS uses TCP port 443 for encrypted client/server communications over TLS. Port 22 is used by the secure shell (SSH) protocol. Port 80 is used by the unencrypted HTTP protocol. Port 1433 is used for Microsoft SQL Server database connections.

- A. An attacker without any special access to the system would only be able to perform ciphertext-only attacks. Known plaintext and chosen plaintext attacks require the ability to encrypt data. Fault injection attacks require physical access to the facility.

- A. Rainbow tables contain precomputed hash values for commonly used passwords and may be used to increase the efficiency of password-cracking attacks.

- C. The PFX format is most closely associated with Windows systems that store certificates in binary format, whereas the P7B format is used for Windows systems storing files in text format. The PEM format is another text format, and the CCM format does not exist.

- B. Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) introduce an inherent latency to the certificate expiration process due to the time lag between CRL distributions.

- D. The Merkleâ€“Hellman Knapsack algorithm, which relies on the difficulty of factoring super-increasing sets, has been broken by cryptanalysts.

- B. SSH2 adds support for simultaneous shell sessions over a single SSH connection. Both SSH1 and SSH2 are capable of supporting multifactor authentication. SSH2 actually drops support for the IDEA algorithm, whereas both SSH1 and SSH2 support 3DES.
