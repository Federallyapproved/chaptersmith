## Personnel Security Policies and Procedures

Humans are often considered the weakest element in any security solution. No matter what physical or logical controls are deployed, humans can discover ways to avoid them, circumvent or subvert them, or disable them. Thus, it is important to take into account the humanity of your users when designing and deploying security solutions for your environment. To understand and apply security governance, you must address the weakest link in your security chain—namely, people.

However, people can also become a key security asset when they are properly trained and are motivated to protect not only themselves but the security of the organization as well. It is important to not treat personnel as a problem to be solved, but as people who can become valued partners in a security endeavor.

Issues, problems, and compromises related to humans occur at all stages of a security solution development. This is because humans are involved throughout the development, deployment, and ongoing management of any solution. Therefore, you must evaluate the effect users, designers, programmers, developers, managers, vendors, consultants, and implementers have on the process.

### Job Descriptions and Responsibilities

Hiring new staff typically involves several distinct steps: creating a job description or position description , setting a classification for the job, screening employment candidates, and hiring and training someone best suited for the job. Without a job description, there is no consensus on what type of individual should be hired. Any job description for any position within an organization should address relevant security issues, such as whether the position requires the handling of sensitive material or access to classified information. In effect, the job description defines the roles to which an employee needs to be assigned to perform their work tasks. Job roles typically align to a rank or level of privilege, whereas job descriptions map to specifically assigned responsibilities and tasks.

Job responsibilities are the specific work tasks an employee is required to perform on a regular basis. Depending on their responsibilities, employees require access to various objects, resources, and services. Thus, a list of job responsibilities guides the assignment of access rights, permissions, and privileges. On a secured network, users must be granted access privileges for those elements related to their work tasks.

Job descriptions are not used exclusively for the hiring process; they should be maintained throughout the life of the organization. Only through detailed job descriptions can a comparison be made between what a person should be responsible for and what they actually are responsible for. Managers should audit privilege assignments to ensure that workers do not obtain access that is not strictly required for them to accomplish their work tasks.

### Candidate Screening and Hiring

Employment candidate screening for a specific position is based on the sensitivity and classification defined by the job description. Thus, the thoroughness of the screening process should reflect the security of the position to be filled.

Employment candidate screening, background checks, reference checks, education verification, and security clearance validation are essential elements in proving that a candidate is adequate, qualified, and trustworthy for a secured position. Background checks include obtaining a candidate's work and educational history; checking references; verifying education; interviewing colleagues; checking police and government records for arrests or illegal activities; verifying identity through fingerprints, driver's license, and/or birth certificate; and holding a personal interview. Depending on the job position, this process could also include skill challenges, drug testing, credit checks, checking driving record, and personality testing/evaluation.

Performing online background checks and reviewing the social networking accounts of applicants has become standard practice for many organizations. If a potential employee has posted inappropriate materials online, then they are not as attractive a candidate as those who did not. A general picture of a person's attitude, intelligence, loyalty, common sense, diligence, honesty, respect, consistency, and adherence to social norms and/or corporate culture can be gleaned quickly by viewing a person's online identity. However, it is important to be fully aware of the legal restrictions against discrimination. Various countries have vastly different freedoms or limitations on background checks, especially criminal history research. Always confirm with the legal department before evaluating applicants for a job position.

During the initial applicant review process, the human resources (HR) staff are looking to confirm that a candidate is properly qualified for a job, but they are also on the lookout for issues that would disqualify the applicant.

Interviewing qualified applicants is the next filter to use to eliminate those who are not suited for the job or the organization. When conducting interviews, it is important to have a standardized interview process in order to treat each candidate fairly. Although some aspects of an interview are subjective and based on the interplay of personalities of the candidates and the interviewer, the decision whether or not to hire someone needs to be legally defensible.

### Onboarding: Employment Agreements and Policies

Once a qualified but not-disqualified candidate is found and interviewed, they can be offered the job. If accepted, the new hire will need to be integrated into the organization. This process is known as onboarding.

Onboarding is the process of adding new employees to the organization, having them review and sign employment agreements and policies, be introduced to managers and coworkers, and be trained in employee operations and logistics. Onboarding can also include organizational socialization and orientation. This is the process by which new employees are trained in order to be properly prepared for performing their job responsibilities. It can include training, job skill acquisition, and behavioral adaptation in an effort to integrate employees efficiently into existing organizational culture, processes, and procedures. Well-designed onboarding can result in higher levels of job satisfaction, higher levels of productivity, faster integration with existing workers, a rise in organizational loyalty, stress reduction, and a decreased occurrence of resignation.

A new employee will be provided a computer/network user account. This is accomplished through the identity and access management (IAM) system of an organization, which will provision the account and assign necessary privileges and access. The onboarding process is also used when an employee's role or position changes or when that person is awarded additional levels of privilege or access.

To maintain security, access should be assigned according to the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege states that users should be granted the minimum amount of access necessary for them to complete their required work tasks or job responsibilities. True application of this principle requires low-level granular control over all resources and functions. Further discussion of least privilege is in Chapter 16 , “Managing Security Operations.”

When a new employee is hired, they should sign an employment agreement. Such a document outlines the rules and restrictions of the organization, the security policy, details of the job description, violations and consequences, and the minimum or probationary length of time the position is to be filled by the employee. These items might be separate documents, such as an acceptable use policy (AUP). In such a case, the employment agreement is used to verify that the employment candidate has read and understood the associated documentation and signed their agreement to adhere to the necessary policies related to their prospective job position.

An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines what is and what is not an acceptable activity, practice, or use for company equipment and resources. The AUP is specifically designed to assign security roles within the organization as well as prescribe the responsibilities tied to those roles. This policy defines a level of acceptable performance and expectation of behavior and activity. Failure to comply with the policy may result in job action warnings, penalties, or termination.

In addition to employment agreements, there may be other security-related documentation that must be addressed. One common document is a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) . An NDA is used to protect the confidential information within an organization from being disclosed by a current or former employee. Violations of an NDA are often met with strict penalties. Throughout a worker's employment, they may be asked to sign additional NDAs as their job responsibilities change and they are needing to access new sensitive, proprietary, or confidential assets. When an employee leaves the organization, they should be reminded of their legal obligation to maintain silence on all items covered by any signed NDAs. In fact, they may be required to re-sign the NDA upon departure as a means to legally confirm that they are fully aware of their legally recognized obligation to maintain trade secrets and other confidential information.

### Employee Oversight

Throughout the employment lifetime of personnel, managers should regularly review or audit the job descriptions, work tasks, privileges, and responsibilities for every staff member. It is common for work tasks and privileges to drift over time. Drifting job responsibilities or privilege creep can also result in security violations. Excess privileges held by a worker represent increased risk to the organization. That risk includes the greater chance for mistakes to damage asset confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) outside of the worker's actual responsibilities, greater ability for a disgruntled worker to cause harm on purpose, and greater ability for an attack that takes over a worker's account to cause harm. Reviewing and then adjusting user capabilities to realign with the principle of least privilege is a risk reduction strategy.

For some organizations, mostly those in the financial industry, a key part of this review process is enforcing mandatory vacations. Mandatory vacations are used as a peer review process. This process requires a worker to be away from the office and without remote access for one to two weeks per year. While the worker is on the “vacation,” a different worker performs their work duties with their actual user account, which makes it easier to verify the work tasks and privileges of employees while attempting to detect abuse, fraud, or negligence on the part of the original employee. This technique often works better than others since it may be possible to hide violations from other accounts, but it is very difficult to commit violations and hide them from the account used to perform them.

Other user and worker management and evaluation techniques include separation of duties, job rotation, and cross-training. These concepts are discussed in Chapter 16 .

When several people work together to perpetrate a crime, it's called collusion . Employing the principles of separation of duties, restricted job responsibilities, mandatory vacations, job rotation, and cross-training reduces the likelihood that a coworker will be willing to collaborate on an illegal or abusive scheme because of the higher risk of detection. Collusion and other privilege abuses can also be reduced through strict monitoring of special privileges and privileged accounts, such as those of an administrator, root, and others.

For many job positions that are considered sensitive or critical, especially in medical, financial, government, and military organizations, periodic revaluation of employees may be needed. This could be a process that is just as thorough as the original background check and investigation performed when the individual was hired, or it may require performing only a few specific checks to confirm consistency in the person's qualifications as well as researching for any new information regarding disqualifications.

User behavior analytics (UBA) and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) are the concepts of analyzing the behavior of users, subjects, visitors, customers, and so forth for some specific goal or purpose. The E in UEBA extends the analysis to include entity activities that take place but that are not necessarily directly linked or tied to a user's specific actions, but that can still correlate to a vulnerability, reconnaissance, intrusion, breach, or exploit occurrence. Information collected from UBA/UEBA monitoring can be used to improve personnel security policies, procedures, training, and related security oversight programs.

### Offboarding, Transfers, and Termination Processes

Offboarding is the reverse of this onboarding process. Offboarding is the removal of an employee's identity from the IAM system once that person has left the organization. But offboarding can also be an element used when an employee transfers into a new job position at the same organization, especially when they are shifting between departments, facilities, or geographic locations. Personnel transfers may be treated as a fire/rehire rather than a personnel move. This depends on the organization's policies and the means they have determined to best manage this change. Some of the elements that go into making the decision as to which procedure to use include whether the same user account will be retained, if their clearance will be adjusted, if their new work responsibilities are similar to the previous position, and if a “clean slate” account is required for auditing purposes in the new job position.

When a full offboarding is going to occur, whether as part of a fire/rehire transfer, a retirement, or a termination, this can include disabling and/or deleting the user account, revoking certificates, canceling access codes, and terminating other specifically granted privileges. It is common to disable accounts of prior employees in order to retain the identity for auditing purposes for a few months. After the allotted time, if no incidents are discovered in regard to the ex-employee's account, then it can be deleted from the IAM completely. If the account is deleted prematurely, any logged events that are of a security concern no longer point to an actual account and thus can make tracking down further evidence of violations more complicated.

An internal employee transfer should not be used to move a problem employee into a different department rather than firing them. Consider the overall CIA and benefit to the organization; if a person is not acceptable as an employee in one department, is it realistic to assume they would be in another? Rather than passing around the problem, the better option is to terminate the problematic employee, especially if direct training and coaching does not provide a resolution.

The offboarding process may also include informing security guards and other physical facility and property access management personnel to disallow entry to the ex-employee in the future.

The procedures for onboarding and offboarding should be clearly documented in order to ensure consistency of application as well as compliance with regulations or contractual obligations. Disclosure of these policies may need to be a standard element of the hiring process.

When an employee must be terminated or offboarded, numerous issues must be addressed. A strong relationship between the security department and HR is essential to maintain control and minimize risks during termination.

Terminations are typically unpleasant processes for all involved. However, when well planned and scripted, they might be elevated to a neutral experience. The intent of a termination policy is to reduce the risk associated with employee termination while treating the person with respect. The termination meeting should take place with at least one witness, preferably a higher-level manager and/or a security guard. Once the employee has been informed of their release, they should be reminded of the liabilities and restrictions placed on the former employee based on the employment agreement, NDAs, and any other security-related documentation. During this meeting, all organization-specific identification, access, or security badges as well as devices, cards, keys, and access tokens should be collected ( Figure 2.1 ). The termination of an employee should be handled in a private and respectful manner. However, this does not mean that precautions should not be taken.

For nonvoluntary terminations where there is a perceived risk of a confrontation, the termination process may need to be abrupt and attended by security guards. Any need to resolve HR issues, retrieve company equipment, review NDAs, and so forth can be handled afterward through an attorney.

For terminations that are expected to be professional as well as for voluntary separations (such as quitting, retiring, or taking extended leave), an additional process may be added known as an exit interview. An exit interview is normally done by an HR person who specializes in those interviews with the idea of learning from the employee's experience. The purpose of an exit interview is to understand why the employee is leaving, what their perspective is of the organization (its personnel, culture, process, etc.), and what they suggest could be done to improve conditions for current and future employees. Information learned from an exit interview may assist the organization with retaining employees through employment improvements and process/policy changes.

Whether an abrupt termination process is used or a cordial process was concluded, the now ex-employee should be escorted off the premises and not allowed to return to their work area without an escort for any reason.

FIGURE 2.1 Ex-employees must return all company property.

FIGURE 2.1 Ex-employees must return all company property.

The following list includes some other security issues that should be handled as soon as possible:

- Remove or disable the employee's user account at the same time as or just before they are notified of being terminated.

- Make sure the employee returns any organizational equipment or supplies from their vehicle or home.

- Arrange for a member of the security department to accompany the released employee while they gather their personal belongings from the work area.

- Inform all security personnel and anyone else who watches or monitors any entrance point to ensure that the ex-employee does not attempt to reenter the building without an escort.

# Firing: Timing Is Everything

Firing an employee has become a complex process. That's why you need a well-designed termination process. However, it must be followed correctly every time. Unfortunately, this doesn't always happen. You might have heard of some fiasco caused by a botched termination procedure. Common examples include performing any of the following before the employee is officially informed of their termination (thus giving the employee prior warning of their termination):

- The IT department requesting the return of a mobile device

- Disabling a network user account

- Blocking a person's personal identification number (PIN) or smartcard for building entrance

- Revoking a parking pass

- Distributing a revised company organizational chart

- Positioning a new employee in their cubicle or workspace

- Allowing layoff information to be leaked to the media

### Vendor, Consultant, and Contractor Agreements and Controls

Vendor, consultant, and contractor controls are used to define the levels of performance, expectation, compensation, and consequences for entities, persons, or organizations that are external to the primary organization.

Multiparty risk exists when several entities or organizations are involved in a project. The risk or threats are often due to the variations of objectives, expectations, timelines, budgets, and security priorities of those involved. Risk management strategies implemented by one party may in fact cause additional risks against or from another party. Often a risk management governing body must be established to oversee the multiparty project and enforce consistent security parameters for the member entities, at least as their interactions relate to the project.

Using service-level agreements (SLAs) is a means to ensure that organizations providing services maintain an appropriate level of service agreed on by both the service provider, vendor, or contractor and the customer organization. You'd be wise to put SLAs in place for any data circuits, applications, information processing systems, databases, or other critical components that are vital to your organization's continued viability. SLAs are important when using any type of third-party service provider, including cloud services. SLAs also commonly include financial and other contractual remedies that kick in if the agreement is not maintained. For example, if a critical circuit is down for more than 15 minutes, the service provider might agree to waive all charges on that circuit for one week.

SLAs and vendor, consultant, and contractor controls are an important part of risk reduction and risk avoidance. By clearly defining the expectations and penalties for external parties, everyone involved knows what is expected of them and what the consequences are in the event of a failure to meet those expectations. Although it may be very cost-effective to use outside providers for a variety of business functions or services, it does increase potential risk by expanding the potential attack surface and range of vulnerabilities. SLAs should include a focus on protecting and improving security in addition to ensuring quality and timely services at a reasonable price. Some SLAs are set and cannot be adjusted, whereas with others you may have significant influence over their content. You should ensure that an SLA supports the tenets of your security policy and infrastructure rather than being in conflict with them, which could introduce weak points, vulnerabilities, or exceptions.

Outsourcing is the term often used to describe the use of an external third party, such as a vendor, consultant, or contractor, rather than performing the task or operation in-house. Outsourcing can be used as a risk response option known as transference or assignment (see the “Risk Response” section, later in this chapter). However, though the risk of operating a function internally is transferred to a third party, other risks are taken on by using a third party. This aspect needs to be evaluated as to whether it is a benefit or a consequence of the SLA.

For more on service-level agreements (SLAs), see Chapter 16 .

Vendors, consultants, and contractors also represent an increase in risk of trade secret theft or espionage. Outsiders often lack the organizational loyalty that internal employees typically have; thus, the temptation to take advantage of intellectual property access opportunities may seem to a perpetrator easier or less of an internal conflict. For more on espionage, see Chapter 17 , “Preventing and Responding to Incidents.”

Some organizations may benefit from a vendor management system (VMS) . A VMS is a software solution that assists with the management and procurement of staffing services, hardware, software, and other needed products and services. A VMS can offer ordering convenience, order distribution, order training, consolidated billing, and more. In regard to security, a VMS can potentially keep communications and contracts confidential, require encrypted and authenticated transactions, and maintain a detailed activity log of events related to vendors and suppliers.

### Compliance Policy Requirements

Compliance is the act of conforming to or adhering to rules, policies, regulations, standards, or requirements. Compliance is an important concern of security governance. On a personnel level, compliance is related to whether individual employees follow company policy and perform their job tasks in accordance with defined procedures. Many organizations rely on employee compliance in order to maintain high levels of quality, consistency, efficiency, and cost savings. If employees do not maintain compliance, it could cost the organization in terms of profit, market share, recognition, and reputation. Employees need to be trained in regard to what they need to do (i.e., stay in line with company standards as defined in the security policy and remain in compliance with any contractual obligations such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [PCI DSS] to maintain the ability to perform credit card processing); only then can they be held accountable for violations or lacking compliance. Compliance is a form of administrative or managerial security control because it focuses on policies and people abiding by those policies (as well as whether the IT and physical elements of the organization comply with policies).

Compliance enforcement is the application of sanctions or consequences for failing to follow policy, training, best practices, and/or regulations. Such enforcement efforts could be performed by the chief information security officer (CISO) or chief security officer (CSO), worker managers and supervisors, auditors, and third-party regulators.

Compliance is also a regulation concern. That topic is covered in Chapter 4 .

### Privacy Policy Requirements

Privacy can be a difficult concept to define. The term is used frequently in numerous contexts without much quantification or qualification. Here are some partial definitions of privacy:

- Active prevention of unauthorized access to information that is personally identifiable (that is, data points that can be linked directly to a person or organization), known as personally identifiable information (PII)

- Freedom from unauthorized access to information deemed personal or confidential

- Freedom from being observed, monitored, or examined without consent or knowledge

When addressing privacy in the realm of IT, there is usually a balancing act between individual rights and the rights or activities of an organization. Some claim that individuals have the right to control whether information can be collected about them and what can be done with it. Others claim that any activity performed in public view—such as most activities performed over the internet or activities performed on company equipment—can be monitored without knowledge of or permission from the individuals being watched, and that the information gathered from such monitoring can be used for whatever purposes an organization deems appropriate or desirable. Some of these issues are determined by law based on country or context, whereas others are left up to organizations and individuals.

Protecting individuals from unwanted observation, direct marketing, and disclosure of private, personal, or confidential details is usually considered a worthy effort. However, some organizations profess that demographic studies, information gleaning, and focused marketing improve business models, reduce advertising waste, and save money for all parties.

There are many legislative and regulatory compliance issues in regard to privacy. Many U.S. regulations—such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act—as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation [EU] 2016/679)—include privacy requirements. It is important to understand all government regulations that your organization is required to adhere to and ensure compliance, especially in the areas of privacy protection.

Whatever your personal or organizational stance is on the issue of online privacy, it should be addressed in an organizational security policy. Privacy is an issue not just for external visitors to your online offerings but also for your customers, employees, suppliers, and contractors. If you gather any type of information about any person or company, you must address privacy.

In most cases, especially when privacy is being violated or restricted, the individuals and companies may need to be informed; otherwise, you may face legal ramifications. Privacy issues must also be addressed when allowing or restricting personal use of email, retaining email, recording phone conversations, gathering information about surfing or spending habits, and so on. All this and more should be codified in a privacy policy (i.e., internal rules) and potentially a privacy statement/disclosure/notice (i.e., explanation to external entities).

Privacy and PII are covered more in Chapter 4 .
