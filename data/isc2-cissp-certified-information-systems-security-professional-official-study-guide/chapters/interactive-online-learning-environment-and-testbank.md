## Interactive Online Learning Environment and TestBank

Studying the material in the (ISC) 2 CISSP: Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, Ninth Edition is an important part of preparing for the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification exam, but we provide additional tools to help you prepare. The online TestBank will help you understand the types of questions that will appear on the certification exam.

The sample tests in the TestBank include all the questions in each chapter as well as the questions from the Assessment test in this Introduction section. In addition, there are four bonus practice exams that you can use to evaluate your understanding and identify areas that may require additional study. These four additional practice exams include 125 questions each and cover the breadth of domain topics in a similar percentage ratio as the real exam. They can be used as real exam simulations to evaluate your preparedness.

The flashcards in the TestBank will push the limits of what you should know for the certification exam. The questions are provided in digital format. Each flashcard has one question and one correct answer.

The online glossary is a searchable list of key terms introduced in this exam guide that you should know for the CISSP certification exam.

New for the 9th edition: Audio Review. Author Mike Chapple reads the Exam Essentials for each chapter providing you with 2 hours and 50 minutes of new audio review for yet another way to reinforce your knowledge as you prepare. We suggest using these audio reviews after you have read each chapter. You can listen to them on your commute, at the gym, or anywhere you read audio books!
