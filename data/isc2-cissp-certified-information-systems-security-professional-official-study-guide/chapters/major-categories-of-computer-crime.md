## Major Categories of Computer Crime

There are many ways to attack a computer system and many motivations to do so. Information system security practitioners generally put crimes against or involving computers into different categories. Simply put, a computer crime is a crime (or violation of a law or regulation) that involves a computer. The crime could be against the computer, or the computer could have been used in the actual commission of the crime. Each of the categories of computer crimes represents the purpose of an attack and its intended result.

Any individual who violates one or more of your security policies is considered to be an attacker . An attacker uses different techniques to achieve a specific goal. Understanding the goals helps clarify the different types of attacks. Remember that crime is crime, and the motivations behind computer crime are no different from the motivations behind any other type of crime. The only real difference may be in the methods the attacker uses to strike.

Computer crimes are generally classified as one of the following types:

- Military and intelligence attacks

- Business attacks

- Financial attacks

- Terrorist attacks

- Grudge attacks

- Thrill attacks

- Hacktivist attacks

It is important to understand the differences among the categories of computer crime to best understand how to protect a system and react when an attack occurs. The type and amount of evidence left by an attacker is often dependent on their expertise. In the following sections, we'll discuss the different categories of computer crimes and the types of evidence you might find after an attack. This evidence can help you determine the attacker's actions and intended target. You may find that your system was only a link in the chain of network hops used to reach the real victim, making the trail harder to follow back to the true attacker.

### Military and Intelligence Attacks

Military and intelligence attacks are launched primarily to obtain secret and restricted information from law enforcement or military and technological research sources. The disclosure of such information could compromise investigations, disrupt military planning, and threaten national security. Attacks to gather military information or other sensitive intelligence often precede other, more damaging attacks.

An attacker may be looking for the following kinds of information:

- Military descriptive information of any type, including deployment information, readiness information, and order of battle plans

- Secret intelligence gathered for military or law enforcement purposes

- Descriptions and storage locations of evidence obtained in a criminal investigation

- Any secret information that could be used in a later attack

Because of the sensitive nature of information collected and used by the military and intelligence agencies, their computer systems are often attractive targets for experienced attackers. To protect from more numerous and more sophisticated attackers, you will generally find more formal security policies in place on systems that house such information. As you learned in Chapter 1 , “Security Governance Through Principles and Policies,” data can be classified according to sensitivity and stored on systems that support the required level of security. It is common to find stringent perimeter security as well as internal controls to limit access to classified documents on military and intelligence agency systems.

You can be sure that serious attacks to acquire military or intelligence information are carried out by professionals. Professional attackers are generally very thorough in covering their tracks. There is usually little evidence to collect after such an attack. Attackers in this category are the most successful and the most satisfied when no one is aware that an attack occurred.

# Advanced Persistent Threats

Recent years have marked the rise of sophisticated attacks known as advanced persistent threats (APTs). The attackers are well funded and have advanced technical skills and resources. They act on behalf of a nation-state, organized crime, terrorist group, or other sponsor and wage highly effective attacks against a very focused target.

### Business Attacks

Business attacks focus on illegally jeopardizing the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and systems operated by a business.

For example, an attacker might focus on obtaining an organization's confidential information. This could be information that is critical to the operation of the organization, such as a secret recipe, or information that could damage the organization's reputation if disclosed, such as personal information about its employees. The gathering of a competitor's confidential intellectual property, also called corporate espionage or industrial espionage , is not a new phenomenon. Businesses have used illegal means to acquire competitive information for many years. Perhaps what has changed is the source of the espionage, as state-sponsored espionage has become a significant threat. The temptation to steal a competitor's trade secrets and the ease with which a savvy attacker can compromise some computer systems makes this type of attack attractive.

The goal of these attacks may be solely to extract confidential information. The use of the information gathered during the attack usually causes more damage than the attack itself. A business that has suffered an attack of this type can be put into a position from which it might not ever recover.

Other attacks may focus on integrity and/or availability of information. For example, although ransomware attacks may jeopardize the confidentiality of information, their primary purpose is to disrupt availability, preventing the target from accessing their own data and forcing the payment of a ransom to restore access.

### Financial Attacks

Financial attacks are carried out to unlawfully obtain money or services. They are the type of computer crime you most commonly hear about in the news. The goal of a financial attack could be to steal credit card numbers, increase the balance in a bank account, or obtain fraudulent funds transfers.

Shoplifting and burglary are both examples of financial attacks. You can usually tell the sophistication of the attacker by the dollar amount of the damages. Less sophisticated attackers seek easier targets, but although the damages are usually minimal, they can add up over time.

Financial attacks launched by sophisticated attackers can result in substantial damages. Even attacks that siphon off small amounts of money in each transaction can accumulate and become serious financial attacks that result in losses amounting to millions of dollars. As with the attacks previously described, the ease with which you can detect an attack and track an attacker is largely dependent on the attacker's skill level.

Financial attacks may also take the form of cybercrime for hire , where the attacker engages in mercenary activity, conducting cyberattacks against targets for their clients. One of the most common examples of this type of attack is in the conduct of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Attackers have assembled large botnets of systems they then lease out to customers for use in DDoS attacks. Here, the attacker actually has no motivation other than receiving money from the customer, who has some other motivation for the attack.

### Terrorist Attacks

Terrorist attacks are a reality in modern society. Our increasing reliance on information systems makes them more and more attractive to terrorists. Such attacks differ from military and intelligence attacks. The purpose of a terrorist attack is to disrupt normal life and instill fear, whereas a military or intelligence attack is designed to extract secret information. Intelligence gathering generally precedes any type of terrorist attack. The very systems that are victims of a terrorist attack were probably compromised in an earlier attack to collect intelligence. The more diligent you are in detecting attacks of any type, the better prepared you will be to intervene before more serious attacks occur.

Possible targets of a computer terrorist attack could be systems that regulate power plants or control telecommunications or power distribution. Many such control and regulatory systems are computerized and vulnerable to terrorist action. In fact, the possibility exists of a simultaneous physical and computerized terrorist attack. Our ability to respond to such an attack would be greatly diminished if the physical attack were simultaneously launched with a computer attack designed to knock out power and communications.

Most large power and communications companies have dedicated a security staff to ensure the security of their systems, but many smaller businesses that have systems connected to the internet are more vulnerable to attacks. You must diligently monitor your systems to identify any attacks and then respond swiftly when an attack is discovered.

### Grudge Attacks

Grudge attacks are attacks that are carried out to damage an organization or a person. The damage could be in the loss of information or information processing capabilities or harm to the organization or a person's reputation. The motivation behind a grudge attack is usually a feeling of resentment, and the attacker could be a current or former employee or someone who wishes ill will upon an organization. The attacker is disgruntled with the victim and takes out their frustration in the form of a grudge attack.

An employee who has recently been fired is a prime example of a person who might carry out a grudge attack to “get back” at the organization. Another example is a person who has been rejected in a personal relationship with another employee. The person who has been rejected might launch an attack to destroy data on the victim's system.

### Real World Scenario

### The Insider Threat

It's common for security professionals to focus on the threat from outside an organization. Indeed, many of our security technologies are designed to keep unauthorized individuals out. We often don't pay enough (or much!) attention to protecting our organizations against the malicious insider, even though they often pose the greatest risk to our computing assets.

One of the authors of this book recently wrapped up a consulting engagement with a medium-sized subsidiary of a large, well-known corporation. The company had suffered a serious security breach, involving the theft of thousands of dollars and the deliberate destruction of sensitive corporate information. The IT leaders in the organization needed someone to work with them to diagnose the cause of the event and protect themselves against similar events in the future.

After only a very small amount of digging, it became apparent that they were dealing with an insider attack. The intruder's actions demonstrated knowledge of the company's IT infrastructure as well as an understanding of which data was most important to the company's ongoing operations.

Additional investigation revealed that the culprit was a former employee who ended his employment with the firm on less-than-favorable terms. He left the building with a chip on his shoulder and an ax to grind. Unfortunately, he was a system administrator with a wide range of access to corporate systems, and the company had an immature deprovisioning process that failed to remove all of his access upon his termination. He simply found several accounts that remained active and used them to access the corporate network through a VPN.

The moral of this story? Don't underestimate the insider threat. Take the time to evaluate your controls to mitigate the risk that malicious current and former employees pose to your organization.

It's also important to understand that not all insider attacks are malicious in origin. Employees with privileged access to systems may make errors that jeopardize security and unintentionally enable an external attacker to carry out a malicious attack.

Your security policy should address the potential of insider attacks. For example, as soon as an employee is terminated, all system access for that employee should be terminated. This action reduces the likelihood of a grudge attack and removes unused access accounts that could be used in future attacks.

Although most grudge attackers are just disgruntled people with limited hacking and cracking abilities, some possess the skills to cause substantial damage. An unhappy cracker can be a handful for security professionals. Take extreme care when a person with known cracking ability leaves your company. At the least, you should perform a vulnerability assessment of all systems the person could access. You may be surprised to find one or more “backdoors” left in the system. (For more on backdoors, see Chapter 21 .) But even in the absence of any backdoors, a former employee who is familiar with the technical architecture of the organization may know how to exploit its weaknesses.

Grudge attacks can be devastating if allowed to occur unchecked. Diligent monitoring and assessing systems for vulnerabilities is the best protection from most grudge attacks.

### Thrill Attacks

Thrill attacks are the attacks launched only for the fun of it. Attackers who lack the ability to devise their own attacks will often download programs that do their work for them. These attackers are often called script kiddies because they run only other people's programs, or scripts, to launch an attack.

The main motivation behind these attacks is the “high” of successfully breaking into a system. If you are the victim of a thrill attack, the most common fate you will suffer is a service interruption. Although an attacker of this type may destroy data, the main motivation is to compromise a system and perhaps use it to launch an attack against another victim.

One common type of thrill attack involves website defacements, where the attacker compromises a web server and replaces an organization's legitimate web content with other pages, often boasting about the attacker's skills. For example, attackers launched a series of automated website defacement attacks in 2017 that exploited a vulnerability in the widely used WordPress web publishing platform. Those attacks managed to deface more than 1.8 million web pages in one week.

### Hacktivists

Recently, the world has seen a rise in the field of “hacktivism.” These attackers, known as hacktivists (a combination of hacker and activist ), often combine political motivations with the thrill of hacking. They organize themselves loosely into groups with names like Anonymous and LulzSec and use tools like the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) to create large-scale DoS attacks with little knowledge required. Their purpose is to disrupt the activity of organizations that they differ with philosophically.

At the extreme end of hacktivism, suicide hackers engage in highly destructive activity with the knowledge that they will most likely be caught. Their motivations may differ, but they feel that they have nothing to lose and do not attempt to hide their activity.
