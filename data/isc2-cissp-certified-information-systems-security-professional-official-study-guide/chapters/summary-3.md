## Summary

Every organization dependent on technological resources for its survival should have a comprehensive business continuity plan in place to ensure the sustained viability of the organization when emergencies take place. Several important concepts underlie solid business continuity planning practices, including project scope and planning, business impact analysis, continuity planning, and approval and implementation.

Every organization must have plans and procedures in place to help mitigate the effects a disaster has on continuing operations and to speed the return to normal operations. To determine the risks to your critical business functions that require mitigation, you must work with a cross-functional team to conduct a business impact analysis from both quantitative and qualitative points of view. You must take the appropriate steps in developing a continuity strategy for your organization and know what to do to weather future disasters.

Finally, you must create the documentation required to ensure the effective communication of your plan to present and future BCP team participants. Such documentation should include the continuity of operations plan (COOP). The business continuity plan must also contain statements of importance, priorities, organizational responsibility, and timing. Also, the documentation should include plans for risk assessment, acceptance, and mitigation; a vital records program; emergency-response guidelines; and procedures for maintenance and testing.

Chapter 18 will take this planning to the next stepâ€”developing and implementing a disaster recovery plan that includes the technical controls required to keep your business running in the face of a disaster.
