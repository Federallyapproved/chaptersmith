## Third-Party Connectivity

Third-party connectivity is a growing concern for almost every business. Very few organizations operate exclusively using internal resources—most organizations interact with outside third-party providers. Most of these external entities do not need to interact directly with an organization's IT/IS. However, for those few that do, it is important to consider the risks and ramifications.

Any time an organizational network is connected directly to another entity's network, their local threats and risks affect each other. A compromise of one organization can lead easily to the compromise of the other. This issue has never been more obvious than with the SolarWinds breach that took place in late 2020. SolarWinds products were used by thousands of companies, as well as numerous agencies in the U.S. government and Department of Defense. It will be years before we fully understand the impact of that intrusion campaign.

Any connection between IT environments should be planned out in detail well in advance of actually interconnecting the cabling (whether physical or virtual). Often, this process starts with an MOU and ends with an ISA.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) or memorandum of agreement (MOA) is an expression of agreement or aligned intent, will, or purpose between two entities. It is not typically a legal agreement or commitment, but rather a more formal form of a reciprocal agreement or handshake (neither of which is typically written down). An MOU can also be called a letter of intent. It is a means to document the specifics of an agreement or arrangement between two parties without necessarily legally binding them to the parameters of the document.

An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a formal declaration of the security stance, risks, and technical requirements of a link between two organizations’ IT infrastructures. The goal of an ISA is to define the expectations and responsibilities of maintaining security over a communications path between two networks. Connecting networks can be mutually beneficial, but it also raises additional risks that need to be identified and addressed. An ISA is a means to accomplish that.

Additionally, a full risk assessment should be performed in order to predict issues and preemptively protect against adverse events as much as possible.

Keep in mind that direct linking of IT environments is not the only possible solution in most circumstances. Using an extranet to host servers to be accessed by the other party via a VPN is a reasonable alternative. Another option is to work with a cloud solution to establish a shared private cloud between the two entities so that only project-related content is ever shared between the two parties. A third option is to keep all datasets separate and use secure email, file sharing, and multimedia collaboration services.

Whatever approach you decide to use, don't let the rush or haste of establishing a new relationship with a third party or engaging in a new project cause security to be discarded or overlooked.

Similar care should be taken when electing to use a cloud service, since they are third parties. As an organization adopts cloud services, from SaaS to IaaS, the level of connectivity and direct interaction with on-premises equipment increases. Clear security guidelines and policies should be established and when possible, technologies such as cloud access security brokers (CASBs) should be deployed to enforce those security requirements.

Yet another possible interpretation of third-party connectivity is a remote worker or telecommuter. As mentioned previously, there needs to be clear justification for allowing remote work, which requires a direct link or access to internal resources. When possible, limit telecommuters to extranet servers or only publicly facing systems (such as email and websites). It may also be important to provide company-owned and -controlled equipment to remote workers rather than depending on personal equipment, which may not be securable or may be used for nonwork purposes or by nonemployees.

Third-party connectivity is a risk that can be managed, but it requires focused and purposed attention. Remember that any means of data transmission or communication can be employed by benign actors for legitimate purposes as well as by adversaries for malicious purposes.
