## Addressing Personnel Safety and Security

Personnel safety concerns are an essential element of security operations. It's always possible to replace things such as data, servers, and even entire buildings. In contrast, it isn't possible to replace people. With that in mind, organizations should implement security controls that enhance personnel safety.

As an example, consider the exit door in a data center controlled by a pushbutton electronic cipher lock. If a fire results in a power outage, does the exit door automatically unlock or remain locked? An organization that values assets in the server room more than personnel safety might decide to ensure that the door remains locked when power isn't available. Doing so protects the physical assets in the data center, but it also risks the lives of personnel within the room because they won't be able to easily exit the room. In contrast, an organization that values personnel safety over the data center's assets will ensure that the locks unlock the exit door when power is lost.

### Duress

Duress systems are useful when personnel are working alone. For example, a single guard might be guarding a building after hours. If a group of people break into the building, the guard probably can't stop them on their own. However, a guard can raise an alarm with a duress system. A simple duress system is just a button that sends a distress call. A monitoring entity receives the distress call and responds based on established procedures. The monitoring entity could initiate a phone call or text message back to the person who sent the distress call. In this example, the guard responds by confirming the situation.

Security systems often include code words or phrases that personnel use to verify that everything truly is okay or verify that there is a problem. For example, a code phrase indicating everything is okay could be “Everything is awesome.” If a guard inadvertently activated the duress system and the monitoring entity responded, the guard says, “Everything is awesome” and then explains what happened. However, if criminals apprehended the guard, the guard could skip the phrase and instead make up a story of how the duress system was accidentally activated. The monitoring entity would recognize that the guard skipped the code phrase and send help.

Some electronic cipher locks support two or more codes, such as one for regular use and one to raise an alarm. Normally, employees would enter a code (such as 1 2 3 4) to open the door to a secure area. In a duress situation, they could enter a different code (such as 5 6 7 8) that would open the door and set off a silent alarm.

### Travel

Another safety concern is when employees travel because criminals might target an organization's employees while they are traveling. Training personnel on safe practices while traveling can enhance their safety and prevent security incidents. This includes simple things such as verifying a person's identity before opening the hotel door. If room service is delivering complimentary food, a call to the front desk can verify if this is valid or part of a scam.

Employees should also be warned about the many risks associated with electronic devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops) when traveling. These risks include the following:

- Sensitive Data Ideally, the devices should not contain any sensitive data. This prevents the loss of data if the devices are lost or stolen. If an employee needs this data while traveling, it should be protected with strong encryption.

- Malware and Monitoring Devices There have been many reported cases of malware being installed on systems while employees were visiting a foreign country. Similarly, we have heard firsthand accounts of physical monitoring devices being installed inside devices after a trip to a foreign country. People might think their devices are safe in a hotel room as they go out to a local restaurant. However, this is more than enough time for someone who otherwise looks like hotel staff to enter your room, install malware in the operating system, and install a physical listening device inside the computer. Maintaining physical control of devices at all times can prevent these attacks. Additionally, security experts recommend that employees do not bring their personal devices but instead bring temporary devices to be used during the trip. After the trip, these can be wiped clean and reimaged.

- Free Wi-Fi Free Wi-Fi often sounds appealing while traveling. However, it can easily be a trap configured to capture all the user's traffic. As an example, attackers can configure a Wi-Fi connection as a man-in-the-middle attack, forcing all traffic to go through the attacker's system. The attacker can then capture all traffic. A sophisticated man-in-the-middle attack (sometimes called an on-path attack) can create an HTTPS connection between the client and the attacker's system and create another HTTPS connection between the attacker's system and an internet-based server. From the client's perspective, it looks like it is a secure HTTPS connection between the client's computer and the internet-based server. However, all the data is decrypted and easily viewable on the attacker's system. Instead, users should have a method of creating their own internet connection, such as through a smartphone or with a mobile wireless hotspot device.

- VPNs Employers should have access to virtual private networks (VPNs) that they can use to create secure connections. These can be used to access resources in the internal network, including their work-related email.

### Emergency Management

Emergency management plans and practices help an organization address personnel safety and security after a disaster. Disasters can be natural (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes) or the result of people's actions (such as fires, terrorist attacks, or cyberattacks causing massive power outages), as discussed in Chapter 18 , “Disaster Recovery Planning.” Organizations will have different plans depending on the types of natural disasters they are likely to experience. The safety of personnel should be a primary consideration during any disaster.

### Security Training and Awareness

Chapter 2 , “Personnel Security and Risk Management Concepts,” covers security training and awareness programs in greater depth. If an organization has a training and awareness program in place, it's relatively easy to add personnel safety and security topics. These programs help ensure that personnel are aware of duress systems, travel best practices, emergency management plans, and general safety and security best practices.

When addressing personnel safety and security, training programs should stress the importance of protecting people. Military warships travel into war zones during times of conflict, putting personnel at risk. However, they also do endless training to protect lives. Organizations rarely face the same level of risk but should still prioritize the value of human lives.
