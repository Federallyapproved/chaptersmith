## Chapter 3: Business Continuity Planning

- Many federal, state, and local laws or regulations require businesses to implement BCP provisions. Including legal representation on your BCP team helps ensure that you remain compliant with laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.

- The “seat-of-the-pants” approach is an excuse used by individuals who do not want to invest time and money in the proper creation of a BCP. This can lead to catastrophe when a firmly laid plan isn't in place to guide the response during a stressful emergency situation.

- Quantitative risk assessment involves using numbers and formulas to make a decision. Qualitative risk assessment includes expertise instead of numeric measures, such as emotions, investor/consumer confidence, and workforce stability.

- The BCP training plan should include a plan overview briefing for all employees and specific training for individuals with direct or indirect involvement. In addition, backup personnel should be trained for each key BCP role.

- The four steps of the BCP process are project scope and planning, business impact analysis, continuity planning, and approval/implementation.
