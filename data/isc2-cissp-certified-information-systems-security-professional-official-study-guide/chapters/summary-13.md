## Summary

Identity and access management (IAM) covers the management, administration, and implementation aspects of granting or restricting access to assets. Assets include information, systems, devices, facilities, and applications. Organizations use both physical and logical access controls to protect them.

Identification is the process of a subject claiming, or professing, an identity. Authentication verifies the subject's identity by comparing one or more authentication factors against a database holding authentication information for users. The three primary authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and something you are. Multifactor authentication uses more than one authentication factor, and it is stronger than using any single authentication factor.

Single sign-on (SSO) technologies allow users to authenticate once and access any resources in a network without authenticating again. Internal networks commonly use SSO, and SSO capabilities are also available on the internet and via the cloud. Federated identity management (FIM) systems link user identities in one system with other systems to implement SSO.

The identity and access provisioning lifecycle includes creating, managing, and deleting accounts used by subjects. Provisioning includes creating the accounts and ensuring that they are granted appropriate access to objects and issuing employees the hardware they need for their job. Onboarding processes inform employees of organizational processes and help set up new employees for success. Deprovisioning processes disable or delete an account when employees leave, and offboarding processes ensure that employees return all the hardware an organization issued to them.
