## Review Questions

- Brian computes the digest of a single sentence of text using a SHA-2 hash function. He then changes a single character of the sentence and computes the hash value again. Which one of the following statements is true about the new hash value? The new hash value will be one character different from the old hash value. The new hash value will share at least 50 percent of the characters of the old hash value. The new hash value will be unchanged. The new hash value will be completely different from the old hash value.
