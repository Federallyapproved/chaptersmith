## Evaluate and Apply Security Governance Principles

Security governance is the collection of practices related to supporting, evaluating, defining, and directing the security efforts of an organization. Optimally, security governance is performed by a board of directors, but smaller organizations may simply have the chief executive officer (CEO) or chief information security officer (CISO) perform the activities of security governance. Security governance seeks to compare the security processes and infrastructure used within the organization with knowledge and insight obtained from external sources. This is why a board of directors is often composed of people from a wide range of backgrounds and industries. The board members can bring their varied experience and wisdom to provide guidance for improvement to the organization they are overseeing.

Security governance principles are often closely related to and often intertwined with corporate and IT governance. The goals of these three governance agendas are often the same or interrelated, such as maintaining business processes while striving toward growth and resiliency.

Some aspects of governance are imposed on organizations due to legislative and regulatory compliance needs, whereas others are imposed by industry guidelines or license requirements. All forms of governance, including security governance, must be assessed and verified from time to time. Various requirements for auditing and validation may be present due to government regulations or industry best practices. This is especially problematic when laws in different countries differ or in fact conflict. The organization as a whole should be given the direction, guidance, and tools to provide sufficient oversight and management to address threats and risks, with a focus on eliminating downtime and keeping potential loss or damage to a minimum.

As you can tell, the definitions of security governance are often rather stilted and high level. Ultimately, security governance is the implementation of a security solution and a management method that are tightly interconnected. Security governance directly oversees and gets involved in all levels of security. Security is not and should not be treated as an IT issue only. Instead, security affects every aspect of an organization. Security is a business operations issue. Security is an organizational process, not just something the IT geeks do behind the scenes. Using the term security governance is an attempt to emphasize this point by indicating that security needs to be managed and governed throughout the organization, not just in the IT department.

There are numerous security frameworks and governance guidelines, including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53 and NIST SP 800-100. Although the NIST guidance is focused on government and military use, it can be adopted and adapted by other types of organization as well. Many organizations adopt security frameworks in an effort to standardize and organize what can become a complex and bewilderingly messy activity, namely, attempting to implement reasonable security governance.

### Third-Party Governance

Third-party governance is the system of external entity oversight that may be mandated by law, regulation, industry standards, contractual obligation, or licensing requirements. The actual method of governance may vary, but it generally involves an outside investigator or auditor. These auditors might be designated by a governing body or might be consultants hired by the target organization.

Another aspect of third-party governance is the application of security oversight to third parties that your organization relies on. Many organizations choose to outsource various aspects of their business operations. Outsourced operations can include security guards, maintenance, technical support, and accounting services. These parties need to stay in compliance with the primary organization's security stance. Otherwise, they present additional risks and vulnerabilities to the primary organization.

Third-party governance focuses on verifying compliance with stated security objectives, requirements, regulations, and contractual obligations. On-site assessments can provide firsthand exposure to the security mechanisms employed at a location. Those performing on-site assessment or audits need to follow auditing protocols (such as Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology [COBIT]) and have a specific checklist of requirements to investigate.

In the auditing and assessment process, both the target and the governing body should participate in full and open document exchange and review. An organization needs to know the full details of all requirements it must comply with. The organization should submit security policy and self-assessment reports back to the governing body. This open document exchange ensures that all parties involved are in agreement about all the issues of concern. It reduces the chances of unknown requirements or unrealistic expectations. Document exchange does not end with the transmission of paperwork or electronic files. Instead, it leads into the process of documentation review.

See Chapter 12 , “Secure Communications and Network Attacks,” for a discussion of third-party connectivity.

### Documentation Review

Documentation review is the process of reading the exchanged materials and verifying them against standards and expectations. The documentation review is typically performed before any on-site inspection takes place. If the exchanged documentation is sufficient and meets expectations (or at least requirements), then an on-site review will be able to focus on compliance with the stated documentation. However, if the documentation is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise insufficient, the on-site review is postponed until the documentation can be updated and corrected. This step is important because if the documentation is not in compliance, chances are the location will not be in compliance either.

In many situations, especially related to government or military agencies or contractors, failing to provide sufficient documentation to meet requirements of third-party governance can result in a loss of or a voiding of authorization to operate (ATO) . Complete and sufficient documentation can often maintain existing ATO or provide a temporary ATO (TATO). However, once an ATO is lost or revoked, a complete documentation review and on-site review showing full compliance is usually necessary to reestablish the ATO.

A portion of the documentation review is the logical and practical investigation of the business processes and organizational policies in light of standards, frameworks, and contractual obligations. This review ensures that the stated and implemented business tasks, systems, and methodologies are practical, efficient, and cost-effective, and most of all (at least in relation to security governance) that they support the goal of security through the reduction of vulnerabilities and the avoidance, reduction, or mitigation of risk. Risk management, risk assessment, and addressing risk are all methods and techniques involved in performing process/policy review.
