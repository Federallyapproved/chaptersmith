## Manage the Security Function

The security function is the aspect of operating a business that focuses on the task of evaluating and improving security over time. To manage the security function, an organization must implement proper and sufficient security governance.

The act of performing a risk assessment to drive the security policy is the clearest and most direct example of management of the security function. The process of risk assessment is discussed in Chapter 2 .

Security must be measurable. Measurable security means that the various aspects of the security mechanisms function, provide a clear benefit, and have one or more metrics that can be recorded and analyzed. Similar to performance metrics, security metrics are measurements of performance, function, operation, action, and so on as related to the operation of a security feature. When a countermeasure or safeguard is implemented, security metrics should show a reduction in unwanted occurrences or an increase in the detection of attempts. The act of measuring and evaluating security metrics is the practice of assessing the completeness and effectiveness of the security program. This should also include measuring it against common security guidelines and tracking the success of its controls. Tracking and assessing security metrics is part of effective security governance.

Managing the security function includes the development and implementation of information security strategies. Most of the content of the CISSP exam, and hence this book, addresses the various aspects of development and implementation of information security strategies.

### Alignment of Security Function to Business Strategy, Goals, Mission, and Objectives

Security management planning ensures proper creation, implementation, and enforcement of a security policy . Security management planning aligns the security functions to the strategy, goals, mission, and objectives of the organization. This includes designing and implementing security based on business cases, budget restrictions, or scarcity of resources. A business case is usually a documented argument or stated position in order to define a need to make a decision or take some form of action. To make a business case is to demonstrate a business-specific need to alter an existing process or choose an approach to a business task. A business case is often made to justify the start of a new project, especially a project related to security. In most organizations, money and resources, such as people, technology, and space, are limited. Due to resource limitations like these, the maximum benefit needs to be obtained from any endeavor.

One of the most effective ways to tackle security management planning is to use a top-down approach . Upper, or senior, management is responsible for initiating and defining policies for the organization. Security policies provide direction for all levels of the organization's hierarchy. It is the responsibility of middle management to flesh out the security policy into standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures. The operational managers or security professionals must then implement the configurations prescribed in the security management documentation. Finally, the end users must comply with all the security policies of the organization.

The opposite of the top-down approach is the bottom-up approach. In a bottom-up approach environment, the IT staff makes security decisions directly without input from senior management. The bottom-up approach is rarely used in organizations and is considered problematic in the IT industry.

Security management is a responsibility of upper management, not of the IT staff, and is considered an issue of business operations rather than IT administration. The team or department responsible for security within an organization should be autonomous. The information security (InfoSec) team should be led by a designated chief information security officer (CISO) who reports directly to senior management, such as the chief information officer (CIO), the chief executive officer (CEO), or the board of directors. Placing the autonomy of the CISO and the CISO's team outside the typical hierarchical structure in an organization can improve security management across the entire organization. It also helps avoid cross-department and internal political issues. The term chief security officer (CSO) is sometimes used as an alternative to CISO, but in many organizations the CSO position is a subposition under the CISO that focuses on physical security. Another potential term for the CISO is information security officer (ISO) , but this also can be used as a subposition under the CISO.

The chief information officer (CIO) focuses on ensuring information is used effectively to accomplish business objectives. The chief technical officer (CTO) focuses on ensuring that equipment and software work properly to support the business functions.

Elements of security management planning include defining security roles; prescribing how security will be managed, who will be responsible for security, and how security will be tested for effectiveness; developing security policies; performing risk analysis; and requiring security education for employees. These efforts are guided through the development of management plans.

The best security plan is useless without one key factor: approval by senior management . Without senior management's approval of and commitment to the security policy, the policy will not succeed. It is the responsibility of the policy development team to educate senior management sufficiently so managers understand the risks, liabilities, and exposures that remain even after security measures prescribed in the policy are deployed. Developing and implementing a security policy is evidence of due diligence and due care on the part of senior management. If a company does not practice due diligence and due care, managers can be held liable for negligence and held accountable for both asset and financial losses.

A security management planning team should develop three types of plans, as shown in Figure 1.3 :

FIGURE 1.3 Strategic, tactical, and operational plan timeline comparison

FIGURE 1.3 Strategic, tactical, and operational plan timeline comparison

- Strategic Plan A strategic plan is a long-term plan that is fairly stable. It defines the organization's security purpose. It defines the security function and aligns it to the goals, mission, and objectives of the organization. It's useful for about five years, if it is maintained and updated annually. The strategic plan also serves as the planning horizon. Long-term goals and visions for the future are discussed in a strategic plan. A strategic plan should include a risk assessment.

- Tactical Plan The tactical plan is a midterm plan developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan, or can be crafted ad hoc based on unpredicted events. A tactical plan is typically useful for about a year and often prescribes and schedules the tasks necessary to accomplish organizational goals. Some examples of tactical plans are project plans, acquisition plans, hiring plans, budget plans, maintenance plans, support plans, and system development plans.

- Operational Plan An operational plan is a short-term, highly detailed plan based on the strategic and tactical plans. It is valid or useful only for a short time. Operational plans must be updated often (such as monthly or quarterly) to retain compliance with tactical plans. Operational plans spell out how to accomplish the various goals of the organization. They include resource allotments, budgetary requirements, staffing assignments, scheduling, and step-by-step or implementation procedures. Operational plans include details on how the implementation processes are in compliance with the organization's security policy. Examples of operational plans are training plans, system deployment plans, and product design plans.

Security is a continuous process. Thus, the activity of security management planning may have a definitive initiation point, but its tasks and work are never fully accomplished or complete. Effective security plans focus attention on specific and achievable objectives, anticipate change and potential problems, and serve as a basis for decision making for the entire organization. Security documentation should be concrete, well defined, and clearly stated. For a security plan to be effective, it must be developed, maintained, and actually used.

### Organizational Processes

Security governance should address every aspect of an organization, including the organizational processes of acquisitions, divestitures, and governance committees. Acquisitions and mergers place an organization at an increased level of risk. Such risks include inappropriate information disclosure, data loss, downtime, or failure to achieve sufficient return on investment (ROI). In addition to all the typical business and financial aspects of mergers and acquisitions, a healthy dose of security oversight and increased scrutiny is often essential to reduce the likelihood of losses during such a period of transformation.

Similarly, a divestiture or any form of asset or employee reduction is another time period of increased risk and thus increased need for focused security governance. Assets need to be sanitized to prevent data leakage. Storage media should be removed and destroyed, because media sanitization techniques do not guarantee against data remnant recovery. Employees released from duty need to be debriefed. This process is often called an exit interview. This process usually involves reviewing any nondisclosure agreements as well as any other binding contracts or agreements that will continue after employment has ceased.

When acquisitions and mergers are made without security considerations, the risks inherent in those obtained products remain throughout their deployment life span. Minimizing inherent threats in acquired elements will reduce security management costs and likely reduce security violations.

It is important to evaluate the risks associated with hardware, software, and services. Products and solutions that have resilient integrated security are often more expensive than those that fail to have a security foundation. However, this additional initial expense is often a much more cost-effective expenditure than addressing security deficiencies over the life of a poorly designed product. Thus, when considering the cost of a merger/acquisition, it is important to consider the total cost of ownership over the life of the product's deployment rather than just initial purchase and implementation.

Acquisition does not relate exclusively to hardware and software. Outsourcing, contracting with suppliers, and engaging consultants are also elements of acquisition. Integrating security assessments when working with external entities is just as important as ensuring a product was designed with security in mind.

In many cases, ongoing security monitoring, management, and assessment may be required. This could be an industry best practice or a regulation. Such assessment and monitoring might be performed by the organization internally or may require the use of external auditors. When engaging third-party assessment and monitoring services, keep in mind that the external entity needs to show security-mindedness in their business operations. If an external organization is unable to manage their own internal operations on a secure basis, how can they provide reliable security management functions for yours?

When evaluating a third party for your security integration, consider the following processes:

- On-Site Assessment Visit the site of the organization to interview personnel and observe their operating habits.

- Document Exchange and Review Investigate the means by which datasets and documentation are exchanged as well as the formal processes by which they perform assessments and reviews.

- Process/Policy Review Request copies of their security policies, processes/procedures, and documentation of incidents and responses for review.

- Third-Party Audit Having an independent third-party auditor, as defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), can provide an unbiased review of an entity's security infrastructure, based on Service Organization Control (SOC) reports. See Chapter 15 for details on SOC reports.

For all acquisitions, establish minimum security requirements. These should be modeled after your existing security policy. The security requirements for new hardware, software, or services should always meet or exceed the security of your existing infrastructure. When working with an external service, be sure to review any service-level agreement (SLA) to ensure that security is a prescribed component of the contracted services. When that external provider is crafting software or providing a service (such as a cloud provider), then a service-level requirement (SLR) may need to be defined. An SLR is a statement of the expectations of service and performance from the product or service of a vendor. Often, an SLR is provided by the customer/client prior to the establishment of the SLA (which should incorporate the elements of the SLR if the vendor expects the customer to sign the agreement).

Two additional examples of organizational processes that are essential to strong security governance are change control/change management (see Chapter 16 , “Managing Security Operations”) and data classification (see Chapter 5 , “Protecting Security of Assets”).

### Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

A security role is the part an individual plays in the overall scheme of security implementation and administration within an organization. Security roles are not necessarily prescribed in job descriptions because they are not always distinct or static. Familiarity with security roles will help in establishing a communications and support structure within an organization. This structure will enable the deployment and enforcement of the security policy. This section focuses on general-purpose security roles for managing an overall security infrastructure. See Chapter 5 for roles related specifically to data management.

The following are the common security roles present in a typical secured environment:

- Senior Manager The organizational owner ( senior manager ) role is assigned to the person who is ultimately responsible for the security maintained by an organization and who should be most concerned about the protection of its assets. The senior manager must sign off on all security policy issues. There is no effective security policy if the senior management does not authorize and support it. The senior manager is the person who will be held liable for the overall success or failure of a security solution and is responsible for exercising due diligence and due care in establishing security for an organization. Even though senior managers are ultimately responsible for security, they rarely implement security solutions. In most cases, that responsibility is delegated to security professionals within the organization.

- Security Professional The security professional , information security (InfoSec) officer , or computer incident response team (CIRT) role is assigned to a trained and experienced network, systems, and security engineer who is responsible for following the directives mandated by senior management. The security professional has the functional responsibility for security, including writing the security policy and implementing it. The role of security professional may be labeled as an IS/IT role, but its focus is on protection more than function. The security professional role is often filled by a team that is responsible for designing and implementing security solutions based on the approved security policy. Security professionals are not decision makers; they are implementers. All decisions must be left to the senior manager.

- Asset Owner The asset owner role is assigned to the person who is responsible for classifying information for placement and protection within the security solution. The asset owner is typically a high-level manager who is ultimately responsible for asset protection. However, the asset owner usually delegates the responsibility of the actual data management tasks to a custodian.

- Custodian The custodian role is assigned to the user who is responsible for the tasks of implementing the prescribed protection defined by the security policy and senior management. The custodian performs all activities necessary to provide adequate protection for the CIA Triad (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) of data and to fulfill the requirements and responsibilities delegated from upper management. These activities can include performing and testing backups, validating data integrity, deploying security solutions, and managing data storage based on classification.

- User The user ( end user or operator ) role is assigned to any person who has access to the secured system. A user's access is tied to their work tasks and is limited so that they have only enough access to perform the tasks necessary for their job position (the principle of least privilege). Users are responsible for understanding and upholding the security policy of an organization by following prescribed operational procedures and operating within defined security parameters.

- Auditor An auditor is responsible for reviewing and verifying that the security policy is properly implemented and the derived security solutions are adequate. The auditor produces compliance and effectiveness reports that are reviewed by the senior manager. Issues discovered through these reports are transformed into new directives assigned by the senior manager to security professionals or custodians.

All of these roles serve an important function within a secured environment. They are useful for identifying liability and responsibility as well as for identifying the hierarchical management and delegation scheme.

### Security Control Frameworks

One of the first and most important security planning steps is to consider the overall security control framework or structure of the security solution desired by the organization. You can choose from several options in regard to security concept infrastructure; however, one of the more widely used security control frameworks is Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) . COBIT is a documented set of best IT security practices crafted by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). It prescribes goals and requirements for security controls and encourages the mapping of IT security ideals to business objectives. COBIT is based on six key principles for governance and management of enterprise IT:

- Provide Stakeholder Value

- Holistic Approach

- Dynamic Governance System

- Governance Distinct from Management

- Tailored to Enterprise Needs

- End-to-End Governance System

COBIT is used not only to plan the IT security of an organization but also as a guideline for auditors. COBIT is a widely recognized and respected security control framework.

Fortunately, COBIT is only modestly referenced on the exam, so further details are not necessary. However, if you have interest in this concept, please visit the ISACA website ( www.isaca.org/cobit ), or if you want a general overview, read the COBIT entry on Wikipedia.

`www.isaca.org/cobit`

There are many other standards and guidelines for IT security. Here are a few:

- NIST 800-53 Rev. 5, “Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations” ( csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final ), contains U.S. government–sourced general recommendations for organizational security.

`csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final`

- The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides OS, application, and hardware security configuration guides at www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks .

- NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) ( csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/rmf-overview ) establishes mandatory requirements for federal agencies. The RMF has six phases: Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor.

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) ( www.nist.gov/cyberframework ) is designed for critical infrastructure and commercial organizations, and consists of five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. It is a prescription of operational activities that are to be performed on an ongoing basis for the support and improvement of security over time.

- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/ International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27000 family group ( www.itgovernanceusa.com/iso27000-family ) is an international standard that can be the basis of implementing organizational security and related management practices.

- Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) ( itlibrary.org ), initially crafted by the British government, is a set of recommended best practices for optimization of IT services to support business growth, transformation, and change. ITIL focuses on understanding how IT and security need to be integrated with and aligned to the objectives of an organization. ITIL and operational processes and is often used as a starting point for the crafting of a customized IT security solution within an established infrastructure.

### Due Diligence and Due Care

Why is planning to plan security so important? One reason is the requirement for due diligence and due care . Due diligence is establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of an organization. Due care is practicing the individual activities that maintain the due diligence effort. For example, due diligence is developing a formalized security structure containing a security policy, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures. Due care is the continued application of this security structure onto the IT infrastructure of an organization. Operational security is the ongoing maintenance of continued due diligence and due care by all responsible parties within an organization. Due diligence is knowing what should be done and planning for it; due care is doing the right action at the right time.

In today's business environment, prudence is mandatory. Showing due diligence and due care is the only way to disprove negligence in an occurrence of loss. Senior management must show due care and due diligence to reduce their culpability and liability when a loss occurs.
