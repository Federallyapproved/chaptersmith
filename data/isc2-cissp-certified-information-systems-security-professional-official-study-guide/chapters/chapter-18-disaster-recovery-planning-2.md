## Chapter 18: Disaster Recovery Planning

- Businesses have three main concerns when considering adopting a mutual assistance agreement. First, the nature of an MAA often necessitates that the businesses be located in close geographical proximity. However, this requirement also increases the risk that the two businesses will fall victim to the same threat. Second, MAAs are difficult to enforce in the middle of a crisis. If one of the organizations is affected by a disaster and the other isn't, the organization not affected could back out at the last minute, leaving the other organization out of luck. Finally, confidentiality concerns (both legal and business related) often prevent businesses from trusting others with their sensitive operational data.

- There are five main types of disaster recovery tests: Read-through tests involve the distribution of recovery checklists to disaster recovery personnel for review. Structured walk-throughs are “tabletop” exercises that involve assembling the disaster recovery team to discuss a disaster scenario. Simulation tests are more comprehensive and may impact one or more noncritical business units of the organization. Parallel tests involve relocating personnel to the alternate site and commencing operations there. Full-interruption tests involve relocating personnel to the alternate site and shutting down operations at the primary site.

- Full backups create a copy of all data stored on a server. Incremental backups create copies of all files modified since the last full or incremental backup. Differential backups create copies of all files modified since the last full backup without regard to any previous differential or incremental backups that may have taken place.

- Cloud computing influences disaster recovery programs in two major ways. First, the cloud provides excellent opportunities for disaster recovery operations, offering on-demand access to technology resources. Second, organizations using the cloud must ensure that they implement disaster recovery capabilities within their cloud environment using controls offered by the cloud service provider, built internally, or offered by third parties.
