## Summary

Security assessment and testing programs play a critical role in ensuring that an organization's security controls remain effective over time. Changes in business operations, the technical environment, security risks, and user behavior may alter the effectiveness of controls that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets. Assessment and testing programs monitor those controls and highlight changes requiring administrator intervention. Security professionals should carefully design their assessment and testing program and revise it as business needs change.

Security testing techniques include vulnerability assessments and software testing. With vulnerability assessments, security professionals perform a variety of tests to identify misconfigurations and other security flaws in systems and applications. Network discovery tests identify systems on the network with open ports. Network vulnerability scans discover known security flaws on those systems. Web vulnerability scans probe the operation of web applications searching for known vulnerabilities.

Software plays a critical role in any security infrastructure because it handles sensitive information and interacts with critical resources. Organizations should use a code review process to allow peer validation of code before moving it to production. Rigorous software testing programs also include the use of static testing, dynamic testing, interface testing, and misuse case testing to robustly evaluate software.

Security management processes include log reviews, account management, backup verification, and tracking of key performance and risk indicators. These processes help security managers validate the ongoing effectiveness of the information security program. They are complemented by formal internal and external audits performed by third parties on a less frequent basis.
