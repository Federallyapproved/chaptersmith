## Chapter 16: Managing Security Operations

- C. The need-to-know policy operates on the basis that any given system user should be granted access only to portions of sensitive information or materials necessary to perform some task. The principle of least privilege ensures that personnel are granted only the permissions they need to perform their job and no more. Separation of duties ensures that no single person has total control over a critical function or system. There isn't a standard principle called “as-needed basis.”

- C. Need to know is the requirement to have access to, knowledge about, or possession of data to perform specific work tasks, but no more. The principle of least privilege includes both rights and permissions, but the term principle of least permission is not valid within IT security. Separation of duties (SoD) ensures that a single person doesn't control all the elements of a process. A separation of duties policy ensures that no single person has total control over a critical function. A job rotation policy requires employees to rotate to different jobs periodically.

- C. An organization applies the least privilege principle to ensure employees receive only the access they need to complete their job responsibilities. Need to know refers to permissions only, whereas privileges include both rights and permissions. A mandatory vacation policy requires employees to take a vacation in one- or two-week increments. An SLA identifies performance expectations and can include monetary penalties.

- D. Microsoft domains include a privileged account management solution that grants administrators elevated privileges when they need them but restrict the access using a time-limited ticket. The principle of least privilege includes both rights and permissions, but the term principle of least permission is not valid within IT security. Separation of duties ensures that a single person doesn't control all the elements of a process or a critical function. Need to know is the requirement to have access to, knowledge about, or possession of data to perform specific work tasks, but no more.

- D. The default level of access should be no access. The principle of least privilege dictates that users should only be granted the level of access they need for their job, and the question doesn't indicate that new users need any access to the database. Read access, modify access, and full access grants users some level of access, which violates the principle of least privilege.

- A. Each account should have only the rights and permissions needed to perform their job when following the least privilege policy. New employees would not need full rights and permissions to a server. Employees will need some rights and permissions in order to do their jobs. Regular user accounts should not be added to the Administrators group.

- C. Separation of duties ensures that no single entity can perform all the tasks for a job or function. A job rotation policy moves employees to different jobs periodically. A mandatory vacation policy requires employees to take vacations. A least privilege policy ensures users have only the privileges they need, and no more.

- A. A job rotation policy has employees rotate jobs or job responsibilities and can help detect collusion and fraud. A separation of duties policy ensures that a single person doesn't control all elements of a specific function. Mandatory vacation policies ensure that employees take an extended time away from their jobs, requiring someone else to perform their job responsibilities, which increases the likelihood of discovering fraud. Least privilege ensures that users have only the permissions they need to perform their jobs and no more.

- B. Mandatory vacation policies help detect fraud. They require employees to take an extended time away from their jobs, requiring someone else to perform their job responsibilities, which increases the likelihood of discovering fraud. It does not rotate job responsibilities. Although mandatory vacations might help employees reduce their overall stress levels and increase productivity, these are not the primary reasons for mandatory vacation policies.

- C. A service-level agreement (SLA) can provide monetary penalties if a third-party provider doesn't meet its contractual requirements. Neither a memorandum of understanding (MOU) nor an interconnection security agreement (ISA) includes monetary penalties. Separation of duties is sometimes shortened to SED, but this is unrelated to third-party relationships.

- A. The IaaS service model provides an organization with the most control compared to the other models, and this model requires the organization to perform all maintenance on operating systems and applications. The SaaS model gives the organization the least control, and the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for all maintenance. The PaaS model splits control and maintenance responsibilities between the CSP and the organization.

- C. The SaaS service model provides services such as email available via a web browser. IaaS provides the infrastructure (such as servers), and PaaS provides a platform (such as an operating system and application installed on a server). Public is a deployment method, not a service model.

- A. When images are used to deploy systems, the systems start with a common baseline, which is important for configuration management. Images don't necessarily improve the evaluation, approval, deployment, and audits of patches to systems within the network. Although images can include current patches to reduce their vulnerabilities, this is because the image provides a baseline. Change management provides documentation for changes.

- C. An effective change management program helps prevent outages from unauthorized changes. Vulnerability management helps detect weaknesses but wouldn't block the problems from this modification. Patch management ensures systems are kept up to date. Blocking scripts removes automation, which would increase the overall workload.

- B, C, D. Change management processes include requesting a change, creating a rollback plan for the change, and documenting the change. Changes should not be implemented immediately without evaluating the change.

- C. Change management aims to ensure that any change does not result in unintended outages or reduce security. Change management doesn't affect personnel safety. A change management plan will commonly include a rollback plan, but that isn't a specific goal of the program. Change management doesn't perform any type of auditing.

- D. An effective patch management program evaluates and tests patches before deploying them and would have prevented this problem. Approving all patches would not prevent this problem because the same patch would be deployed. Systems should be audited after deploying patches, not to test for the impact of new patches.

- A. A patch management system ensures that systems have required patches. In addition to deploying patches, it would also check the systems to verify they accepted the patches. There is no such thing as a patch scanner. A penetration test will attempt to exploit a vulnerability, but it can be intrusive and cause an outage, so it isn't appropriate in this scenario. A fuzz tester sends random data to a system to check for vulnerabilities but doesn't test for patches.

- B. Vulnerability scanners are used to check systems for known issues and are part of an overall vulnerability management program. Versioning is used to track software versions and is unrelated to detecting vulnerabilities. Security audits and reviews help ensure that an organization is following its policies but wouldn't directly check systems for vulnerabilities.

- D. A vulnerability scan will list or enumerate all security risks within a system. None of the other answers will list security risks within a system. Configuration management systems check and modify configuration settings. Patch management systems can deploy patches and verify patches are deployed, but they don't check for all security risks. Hardware inventories only verify the hardware is still present.
