## Chapter 13: Managing Identity and Authentication

- Physical access controls are anything you can touch. They include perimeter security controls (such as fences and gates) and environmental controls such as heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Logical access controls are also known as technical controls. They include authentication, authorization, and permission controls.

- Identification occurs when a subject claims an identity, such as with a username. Authentication occurs when the subject provides information to verify the claimed identity is the subject's identity. For example, a user provides the correct password matched to the username. Authorization is the process of granting the subject rights and permissions based on the subject's proven identity. Accountability is accomplished by logging subjects' actions and is reliable only if the identification and authentication processes are strong and secure.

- The three authentication types are something you know, something you have, and something you are, also known as Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Something you know is a memorized secret such as a password or PIN. Something you have includes devices that a person can touch and hold, such as a smartcard or hardware token. Something you are uses biometric methods such as fingerprints or facial identification.

- Federated identity management systems allow single sign-on (SSO) to be extended beyond a single organization. SSO allows users to authenticate once and access multiple resources without authenticating again. SAML is a common language used to exchange federated identity information between organizations.

- Organizations use provisioning and onboarding processes when hiring employees and deprovisioning and offboarding processes when an employee leaves.
