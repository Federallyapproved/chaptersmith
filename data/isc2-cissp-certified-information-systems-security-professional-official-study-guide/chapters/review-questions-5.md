## Review Questions

- Which of the following provides the best protection against the loss of confidentiality for sensitive data? Data labels Data classifications Data handling Data degaussing methods

- Administrators regularly back up data on all the servers within your organization. They annotate an archive copy with the server it came from and the date it was created, and transfer it to an unstaffed storage warehouse. Later, they discover that someone leaked sensitive emails sent between executives on the internet. Security personnel discovered some archive tapes are missing, and these tapes probably included the leaked emails. Of the following choices, what would have prevented this loss without sacrificing security? Mark the media kept off site. Don't store data off site. Destroy the backups off site. Use a secure off-site storage facility.
