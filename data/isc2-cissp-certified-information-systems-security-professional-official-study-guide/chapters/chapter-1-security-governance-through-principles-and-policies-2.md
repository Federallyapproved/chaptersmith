## Chapter 1: Security Governance Through Principles and Policies

- The CIA Triad is the combination of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality is the concept of the measures used to ensure the protection of the secrecy of data, information, or resources. Integrity is the concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data. Availability is the concept that authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects. The term CIA Triad is used to indicate the three key components of a security solution.

- The requirements of accountability are identification, authentication, authorization, and auditing. Each of these components needs to be legally supportable to truly hold someone accountable for their actions.

- The six security roles are senior management, IT/security staff, owner, custodian, operator/user, and auditor.

- The four components of a security policy are policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures. Policies are broad security statements. Standards are definitions of hardware and software security compliance. Guidelines are used when there is not an appropriate procedure. Procedures are detailed step-by-step instructions for performing work tasks in a secure manner.
