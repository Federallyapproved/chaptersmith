## Apply Security Principles to Site and Facility Design

Without control over the physical environment, no collection of administrative, technical, or logical security controls can provide adequate protection. If a malicious person can gain physical access to your facility or equipment, they can do just about anything they want, including destruction, disclosure, and alteration.

There are many aspects of implementing and maintaining physical security. A core element is selecting or designing the facility to house your IT infrastructure and your organization's operations. The process of selecting or designing facilities security always starts with a plan.

### Secure Facility Plan

A secure facility plan outlines the security needs of your organization and emphasizes methods or mechanisms to employ to provide security. Such a plan is developed through risk assessment and critical path analysis. Critical path analysis is a systematic effort to identify relationships between mission-critical applications, processes, and operations and all the necessary supporting elements. For example, an online store relies on internet access, computer hardware, electricity, temperature control, storage facilities, and so on.

When critical path analysis is performed properly, a complete picture of the interdependencies and interactions necessary to sustain the organization is produced. The first step in designing a secure IT infrastructure is providing security for the basic requirements of the organization and its computers. These basic requirements include electricity, environmental controls (in other words, a building, air conditioning, heating, humidity control, and so on), and water/sewage.

While examining for critical paths, it is also important to evaluate completed or potential technology convergence. Technology convergence is the tendency for various technologies, solutions, utilities, and systems to evolve and merge over time. Often this results in multiple systems performing similar or redundant tasks or one system taking over the features and abilities of another. Though in some instances this can result in improved efficiency and cost savings, it can also represent a single point of failure and become a more valuable target for malicious hackers and intruders. For example, if voice, video, building control, storage (i.e., NAS), and productivity traffic all share a single connection path rather than individual paths, a single act of sabotage to the main connection is all that is required for intruders or thieves to sever external communications.

Security staff should participate in site and facility design considerations. Otherwise, many important aspects of physical security essential for the existence of logical security may be overlooked. With security staff involved in the physical facility design, you can be assured that your long-term security goals as an organization will be supported not just by your policies, personnel, and electronic equipment, but also by the building itself.

A secure facility plan is based on a layered defense model. Only with overlapping layers of physical security can a reasonable defense be established against would-be intruders. Physical security should be thought of as establishing an obstacle course or gauntlet that attackers have to attempt to work their way through. Thus, security mechanisms are positioned to operate in series rather than in parallel to optimize the difficulty in breaching the protective infrastructure.

### Site Selection

Site selection should be based on the security needs of the organization. Cost, location, and size are important, but addressing the requirements of security should always take precedence.

Securing assets depends largely on site security, which involves numerous considerations and situational elements. Site location and construction play a crucial role in the overall site selection process.

Proximity to other buildings and businesses is a crucial consideration. What sorts of attention do they draw, and how does that affect your operation or facility? If a nearby business attracts too many visitors, generates lots of noise, causes vibrations, or handles dangerous materials, they could harm your employees or buildings. Proximity to emergency-response personnel is another consideration, along with other elements.

At a minimum, ensure that the building is designed to withstand typical extreme weather conditions for the area and that it can deter or fend off most overt break-in attempts. Vulnerable entry points such as windows and doors tend to dominate such analysis, but you should also evaluate objects (trees, shrubs, planters, columns, storage buildings, or other person-made items) that can obscure break-in attempts.

Does your organization need to be easily accessed and thus clearly visible? Or would it be a better design to not stand out? Industrial camouflage is the attempt to mask or hide the actual function, purpose, or operations of a facility by providing a façade presenting a believable or convincing alternative. For example, a data center may present itself as a food-packing facility.

### Facility Design

The top priority of security should always be the protection of the life and safety of personnel. To that end, be sure that all facility designs and physical security controls are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. These may include health and safety requirements, building codes, labor restrictions, and more. In the United States, some common regulations to follow in regard to facility security are guidelines and requirements from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). For most organizations, it may be worthwhile to have a facility security officer to assist with the design, implementation, management, and oversight of facility security.

Important issues to consider include combustibility, fire rating, construction materials, load rating, placement, and control of items such as walls, doors, ceilings, flooring, HVAC, power, water, sewage, gas, and so on. Forced intrusion, emergency access, resistance to entry, direction of entries and exits, use of alarms, and conductivity are other important aspects to evaluate. Every element within a facility should be evaluated in terms of how it could be used for and against the protection of the IT infrastructure and personnel (for example, positive flows for air and water from inside a facility to outside its boundaries).

There's also a well-established school of thought on “secure architecture” that's often called Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) . CPTED addresses facility design, landscaping, entrance concepts, campus layouts, lighting, road placement, and traffic management of vehicles and those on foot.

The core principle of CPTED is that the design of the physical environment can be managed, manipulated, and crafted with intention in order to create behavioral effects or changes in people present in those areas that result in reduction of crime as well as a reduction of the fear of crime. Just think of a dark back alley with sunken doorways and several large trash dumpsters; then compare that to a well-lit street with a broad sidewalk with attractive storefronts. Notice the feelings you have about those locations just by thinking about them. CPTED design-guided locations have an amazing but subtle effect on the behaviors of people as well as their perceptions of a location.

CPTED has numerous recommendations and suggestions for improving facility design for security purposes, such as the following:

- Keep planters under 2.5 feet tall—this prevents them from being used to hide behind or as a step to reach a window.

- Keep decorative elements small or far away from the building.

- Locate the data center at the core of the building.

- Provide benches and tables to encourage people to sit and look around; they provide a type of automatic surveillance.

- Mount cameras in full view to act as a deterrent.

- Keep entrances open and clear (i.e., without obstacles like trees or columns) so that visibility can be maintained.

- Keep the number of entrances to a minimum and close off doorways during evenings or weekends when fewer workers are present.

- Provide parking for visitors near the entrance.

- Make delivery access driveways and entrances less visible or noticeable to the public—for example, by positioning them on the back of the building and requiring the use of an alternate road.

CPTED has three main strategies: natural access control, natural surveillance, and natural territorial reinforcement. Natural access control is the subtle guidance of those entering and leaving a building through placement of entranceways, use of fences and bollards, and placement of lights. The idea here is to make the entrance point to a building look like an entrance point without having to resort to giant signs saying “Enter Here!” This can also extend internally by creating security zones to distinguish the general access areas from those of higher security that require certain classification or job responsibilities to enter. Those areas of the same access level should be open, inviting, and easy to move around in, but those areas that are restricted or closed off should seem more difficult to access and require more effort and intention of the individual to access.

Natural surveillance is any means to make criminals feel uneasy through the increasing of opportunities for them to be observed. This can be accomplished by an open and obstacle-free outside area, especially around entrances, with clear lines of sight. This can be further increased by encouraging workers and even the public to loiter around the area by providing a pleasing landscape (not directly against the buildings) with plenty of seating. Walkways and stairways should be open so that others nearby can easily see if someone is present. And all areas should be very well lit throughout the day, but especially at night.

Natural territorial reinforcement is the attempt to make the area feel like an inclusive, caring community. The area should be designed so that it looks cared for and respected, and that it is actively being defended. This can be accomplished with decorations, flags, lighting, landscaping, presentations of company logos, clearly visible building numbers, and decorative sidewalks and other architectural features. This approach may cause intruders to feel like they don't belong and that their activities would be at a higher risk of being detected.

The International CPTED Association is an excellent source for information on this subject ( cpted.net ), as is Oscar Newman's book Creating Defensible Space, published by HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (you can obtain a free PDF download at www.huduser.gov/publications/pdf/def.pdf ).

The use of CPTED does not substitute for the use of actual target hardening, such as locked doors, security guards, fences, and bollards. However, a mixture of traditional physical barriers and CPTED strategies can provide both preventive security and detective and deterrent security.
