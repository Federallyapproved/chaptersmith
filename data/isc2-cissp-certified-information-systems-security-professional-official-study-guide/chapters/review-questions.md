- Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is a means to ensure that all the vendors or links in the supply chain are reliable, trustworthy, reputable organizations. Which of the following are true statements? (Choose all that apply.) Each link in the supply chain should be responsible and accountable to the next link in the chain.
