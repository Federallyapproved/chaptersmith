## Summary

When designing and deploying security solutions, you need to protect your environment from potential human threats. The aspects of secure hiring practices, defining roles, setting policies, following standards, reviewing guidelines, detailing procedures, performing risk management, providing awareness training, and cultivating management planning all contribute to protecting assets.

Secure hiring practices require detailed job descriptions. Job descriptions are used as a guide for selecting candidates and properly evaluating them for a position. Job responsibilities are the specific work tasks an employee is required to perform on a regular basis.

Employment candidate screening, background checks, reference checks, education verification, and security clearance validation are essential elements in proving that a candidate is adequate, qualified, and trustworthy for a secured position.

Onboarding involves integrating a new hire into the organization, which includes organizational socialization and orientation. When a new employee is hired, they should sign an employment agreement/contract and possibly a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). These documents define the responsibilities and legal liabilities of the relationship between the employee and the organization.

Throughout the employment lifetime of personnel, managers should regularly review or audit the job descriptions, work tasks, privileges, and responsibilities for every staff member. For some industries, mandatory vacations may be needed. Collusion and other privilege abuses can be reduced through strict monitoring of special privileges.

Offboarding is the removal of an employee's identity from the IAM system, or it may be a part of process of employee transfer to another division of the organization. A termination policy is needed to protect an organization and its remaining employees. The termination procedure should include an exit interview, reminder of NDAs, return of company property, and disabling of network access.

Vendor, consultant, and contractor controls (i.e., an SLA) are used to define the levels of performance, expectation, compensation, and consequences for external entities, persons, or organizations.

Compliance is the act of conforming to or adhering to rules, policies, regulations, standards, or requirements. Compliance is an important concern to security governance.

When addressing privacy in the realm of IT, there is usually a balancing act between individual rights and the rights or activities of an organization. You must consider many legislative and regulatory compliance issues in regard to privacy.

The primary goal of risk management is to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Determining this level depends on the organization, the value of its assets, and the size of its budget. Risk analysis/assessment is the process by which risk management is achieved and includes inventorying assets, analyzing an environment for threats, and evaluating each risk as to its likelihood of occurring and the cost of the resulting damage. Risk response is the assessing of the cost of various countermeasures for each risk and creating a cost/benefit report for safeguards to present to upper management.

Social engineering is a form of attack that exploits human nature and human behavior. Social engineering attacks take two primary forms: convincing someone to perform an unauthorized operation or convincing someone to reveal confidential information. The most effective defense against social engineering attacks is user education and awareness training.

The common social engineering principles are authority, intimidation, consensus, scarcity, familiarity, trust, and urgency. Eliciting information is the activity of gathering or collecting information from systems or people. Social engineering attacks include phishing, spear phishing, business email compromise (BEC), whaling, smishing, vishing, spam, shoulder surfing, invoice scams, hoaxes, impersonation, masquerading, tailgating, piggybacking, dumpster diving, identity fraud, typo squatting, and influence campaigns.

For a security solution to be successfully implemented, user behavior must change. Behavior modification involves some level of learning on the part of the user. There are three commonly recognized learning levels: awareness, training, and education.

Security-focused awareness and training programs should be reassessed and revised regularly. Some security awareness and training programs can benefit from security champions or gamification.
