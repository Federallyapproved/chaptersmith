## Ethics

Security professionals hold themselves and each other to a high standard of conduct because of the sensitive positions of trust they occupy. The rules that govern personal conduct are collectively known as rules of ethics . They are the moral codes and rules of personal behavior that guide our day-to-day activities in any realm. In the world of business, ethics describe how a business should govern itself to ensure that its actions are appropriate and just. Business ethics cover a wide variety of topics, including financial dealings, conflicts of interest, nondiscrimination, and social responsibility.

In the world of cybersecurity, ethical codes guide the conduct of cybersecurity professionals to ensure that they act in a manner that is responsible and just. Several organizations have recognized the need for standard ethics rules, or codes, and have devised guidelines for ethical behavior.

We present several codes of ethics in the following sections. These rules are not laws—they are minimum standards for professional behavior. They should provide you with a basis for sound, ethical judgment. We expect all security professionals to abide by these guidelines regardless of their area of specialty or employer. Make sure you understand and agree with the codes of ethics outlined in the following sections.

### Organizational Code of Ethics

Almost every organization has its own code of ethics that is published to employees to help guide their everyday work. These may come in the form of an official ethics statement, or they may be embodied in the policies and procedures that the organization uses to carry out routine business activities.

In cases where an ethical code is published as a separate statement, it is usually high-level, designed to provide general guidance and direction rather than address specific situations. The organizational code of ethics may be supplemented by other policies and rules that provide detailed guidance on specific issues.

For example, the U.S. government has a Code of Ethics for Government Service that is written into federal law. Passed by Congress in 1980, this code says that any person in government service should:

- Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.

- Uphold the Constitution, laws, and regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.

- Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving earnest effort and best thought to the performance of duties.

- Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.

- Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or herself or for family members, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.

- Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.

- Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of governmental duties.

- Never use any information gained confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means of making private profit.

- Expose corruption wherever discovered.

- Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

### (ISC) 2 Code of Ethics

The governing body that administers the CISSP certification is the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC) 2 . The (ISC) 2 Code of Ethics was developed to provide the basis for CISSP behavior. It is a simple code with a preamble and four canons. The following is a short summary of the major concepts of the Code of Ethics.

All CISSP candidates should be familiar with the entire (ISC) 2 Code of Ethics because they have to sign an agreement that they will adhere to this code. We won't cover the code in depth, but you can find further details about the (ISC) 2 's Code of Ethics at www.isc2.org/ethics . You need to visit this site and read the entire code.

#### Code of Ethics Preamble

The Code of Ethics preamble is as follows:

- The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and to each other requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.

- Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.

#### Code of Ethics Canons

The Code of Ethics ( https://www.isc2.org/Ethics# ) includes the following canons:

- Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure. Security professionals have great social responsibility. We are charged with the burden of ensuring that our actions benefit the common good.

- Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally. Integrity is essential to the conduct of our duties. We cannot carry out our duties effectively if others within our organization, the security community, or the general public have doubts about the accuracy of the guidance we provide or the motives behind our actions.

- Provide diligent and competent service to principals. Although we have responsibilities to society as a whole, we also have specific responsibilities to those who have hired us to protect their infrastructure. We must ensure that we are in a position to provide unbiased, competent service to our organization.

- Advance and protect the profession. Our chosen profession changes on a continuous basis. As security professionals, we must ensure that our knowledge remains current and that we contribute our own knowledge to the community's common body of knowledge.

#### Code of Ethics Complaints

(ISC) 2 members who encounter a potential violation of the Code of Ethics may report the possible violation to (ISC) 2 for investigation by filing a formal ethics complaint. This complaint must identify the specific canon of the Code of Ethics that the member believes has been violated. Furthermore, complaints are only accepted from those who believe they have been injured by the alleged behavior. This personal injury provides standing to file a complaint and is determined based on the canon involved:

- Any member of the general public may file a complaint involving canons I or II.

- Only an employer or someone with a contracting relationship with the individual may file a complaint under canon III.

- Other professionals may file a complaint under canon IV. It is important to note that this is not limited to cybersecurity professionals. Anyone who is certified or licensed as a professional and subscribes to a code of ethics as part of that licensure or certification is eligible to file a canon IV complaint.

Complaints under the Code of Ethics must be in writing and in the form of a sworn affidavit. When (ISC) 2 receives a properly submitted complaint, they will undertake a formal investigation. For more information on the complaint and investigation process, see www.isc2.org/Ethics . Violations of the Code of Ethics may be punished by sanctions up to and including the revocation of an individual's certification.

### Ethics and the Internet

A variety of ethical frameworks also exist to help guide digital activities. These codes are not binding on any particular organization but are useful references for ethical decision making.

#### RFC 1087

In January 1989, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) recognized that the internet was rapidly expanding beyond the initial trusted community that created it. Understanding that misuse could occur as the internet grew, IAB issued a statement of policy concerning the proper use of the internet. The contents of this statement are valid even today. It is important that you know the basic contents of the document, titled “Ethics and the Internet,” request for comments (RFC) 1087, because most codes of ethics can trace their roots back to this document.

The statement is a brief list of practices considered unethical. Whereas a code of ethics states what you should do, this document outlines what you should not do. RFC 1087 states that any activity with the following purposes is unacceptable and unethical:

- Seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the internet

- Disrupts the intended use of the internet

- Wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such actions

- Destroys the integrity of computer-based information

- Compromises the privacy of users

#### Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics

The Computer Ethics Institute created its own code of ethics ( http://cpsr.org/issues/ethics/cei ). The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics are as follows:

- Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.

- Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.

- Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.

- Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.

- Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.

- Thou shalt not copy proprietary software for which you have not paid.

- Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.

- Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.

- Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.

- Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.

#### Code of Fair Information Practices

Another formative document that guides many ethical decision-making efforts is the Code of Fair Information Practices, developed by a government advisory committee in 1973. This code outlines five principles for handling personal information in an ethical and responsible manner:

- There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret.

- There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the person is in a record and how it is used.

- There must be a way for a person to prevent information about the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without the person's consent.

- There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about the person.

- Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data.
