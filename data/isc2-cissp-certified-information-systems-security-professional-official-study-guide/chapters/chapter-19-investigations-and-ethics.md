## Chapter 19: Investigations and Ethics

- C. A crime is any violation of a law or regulation. The violation stipulation defines the action as a crime. It is a computer crime if the violation involves a computer, either as the target or as a tool. Computer crimes may not be defined in an organization's policy, since crimes are only defined in law. Illegal attacks are indeed crimes, but this is too narrow a definition. The failure to practice due diligence may be a liability but, in most cases, is not a criminal action.

- B. A military and intelligence attack targets the classified data that resides on the system. To the attacker, the value of the information justifies the risk associated with such an attack. The information extracted from this type of attack is often used to plan subsequent attacks.

- A. The Code of Ethics does not require that you protect your colleagues.

- A, C, D. A financial attack focuses primarily on obtaining services and funds illegally. Accessing services that you have not purchased is an example of obtaining services illegally. Transferring funds from an unapproved source is obtaining funds illegally, as is leasing out a botnet for use in DDoS attacks. Disclosing confidential information is not necessarily financially motivated.

- B. A terrorist attack is launched to interfere with a way of life by creating an atmosphere of fear. A computer terrorist attack can reach this goal by reducing the ability to respond to a simultaneous physical attack. Although terrorists may engage in other actions, such as altering information, stealing data, or transferring funds, as part of their attacks, these items alone are not indicators of terrorist activity.

- D. Any action that can harm a person or organization, either directly or through embarrassment, would be a valid goal of a grudge attack. The purpose of such an attack is to “get back” at someone.

- A, C. Thrill attacks have no reward other than providing a boost to pride and ego. The thrill of launching the attack comes from the act of participating in the attack (and not getting caught).

- C. Although the other options have some merit in individual cases, the most important rule is to never modify, or taint, evidence. If you modify evidence, it becomes inadmissible in court.

- D. The most compelling reason for not removing power from a machine is that you will lose the contents of memory. Carefully consider the pros and cons of removing power. After all is considered, it may be the best choice.

- C. Written documents brought into court to prove the facts of a case are referred to as documentary evidence. The best evidence rule states that when a document is used as evidence in a court proceeding, the original document must be introduced. The parol evidence rule states that when an agreement between parties is put into written form, the written document is assumed to contain all the terms of the agreement, and no verbal agreements may modify the written agreement. Testimonial evidence is evidence consisting of the testimony of a witness, either verbal testimony in court or written testimony in a recorded deposition.

- C. Criminal investigations may result in the imprisonment of individuals and, therefore, have the highest standard of evidence to protect the rights of the accused.

- B. Root cause analysis seeks to identify the reason that an operational issue occurred. The root cause analysis often highlights issues that require remediation to prevent similar incidents in the future. Forensic analysis is used to obtain evidence from digital systems. Network traffic analysis is an example of a forensic analysis category. Fagan inspection is a software testing technique.

- A. Preservation ensures that potentially discoverable information is protected against alteration or deletion. Production places the information into a format that may be shared with others and delivers it to other parties, such as opposing counsel. Processing screens the collected information to perform a “rough cut” of irrelevant information, reducing the amount of information requiring detailed screening. Presentation displays the information to witnesses, the court, and other parties.

- B. Server logs are an example of documentary evidence. Gary may ask that they be introduced in court and will then be asked to offer testimonial evidence about how he collected and preserved the evidence. This testimonial evidence authenticates the documentary evidence.

- B. In this case, you need a search warrant to confiscate equipment without giving the suspect time to destroy evidence. If the suspect worked for your organization and you had all employees sign consent agreements, you could simply confiscate the equipment.

- A. Log files contain a large volume of generally useless information. However, when you are trying to track down a problem or an incident, log files can be invaluable. Even if an incident is discovered as it is happening, it may have been preceded by other incidents. Log files provide valuable clues and should be protected and archived, often by forwarding log entries to a centralized log management system.

- D. Review examines the information resulting from the Processing phase to determine what information is responsive to the request and remove any information protected by attorney-client privilege. Identification locates the information that may be responsive to a discovery request when the organization believes that litigation is likely. Collection gathers the relevant information centrally for use in the eDiscovery process. Processing screens the collected information to perform a “rough cut” of irrelevant information, reducing the amount of information requiring detailed screening.

- D. Ethics are simply rules of personal behavior. Many professional organizations establish formal codes of ethics to govern their members, but ethics are personal rules individuals use to guide their lives.

- B. The second canon of the (ISC) 2 Code of Ethics states how a CISSP should act, which is honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.

- B. RFC 1087 does not specifically address the statements in option A, C, or D. Although each type of activity listed is unacceptable, only “actions that compromise the privacy of users” are explicitly identified in RFC 1087.
