## Chapter 16: Managing Security Operations

- Need to know focuses on permissions and the ability to access information, whereas the least privilege principle focuses on privileges. Privileges include both rights and permissions. Both limit the access of users and subjects to only what they need. Following these principles prevents and limits the scope of security incidents.

- Monitoring the assignment of special privileges detects when individuals are granted higher privileges, such as when they are added to an administrator account. It can detect when unauthorized entities are granted higher privileges. Monitoring the usage of special privileges detects when entities are using higher privileges, such as creating unauthorized accounts, accessing or deleting logs, and creating automated tasks. This monitoring can detect potential malicious insiders and remote attackers.

- The three models are software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). The cloud service provider (CSP) provides the most maintenance and security services with SaaS, less with PaaS, and the least with IaaS. NIST SP 800-144 provides these definitions, but CSPs sometimes use their own terms and definitions in marketing materials.

- Change management processes help prevent outages by ensuring that proposed changes are reviewed and tested before being deployed. They also ensure that changes are documented.
