## Perform Configuration Management (CM)

Configuration management (CM) helps ensure that systems are deployed in a secure, consistent state and that they stay in a secure, consistent state throughout their lifetime. Baselines and images are commonly used to deploy systems.

### Provisioning

Provisioning new systems refers to installing and configuring the operating system and needed applications. Deploying operating systems and applications using all of the defaults typically enables many vulnerabilities. Instead, new systems should be configured to reduce the vulnerabilities.

A key consideration when provisioning a system is to harden it based on its use. Hardening a system makes it more secure than the default configuration and includes the following:

- Disable all unused services. As an example, a file server needs services that allow users to access files, but file servers rarely use FTP. If the server is not using FTP, it should be disabled.

- Close all unused logical ports. These are often closed by disabling unused services.

- Remove all unused applications. Some applications automatically add additional applications. If these aren't used, they should be removed.

- Change default passwords. Many applications have default passwords for some accounts. Attackers know these, so the passwords should be changed.

### Baselining

A baseline is a starting point. In the context of configuration management, it is the starting configuration for a system. An easy way to think of a baseline is as a list of settings. An operating system baseline identifies all the settings to harden specific systems. For example, a baseline for a file server identifies the configuration settings to harden the file server. Desktop computers would have a different baseline. Although baselines provide a starting point, administrators often modify them as needed for different systems within their organization.

### Using Images for Baselining

Many organizations use images to deploy baselines. Figure 16.2 shows the process of creating and deploying baseline images in an overall three-step process. Here are the steps:

In practice, more details are involved in this process, depending on the tools used for imaging. For example, the steps to capture and deploy images using one product are different from the steps to capture and deploy images using another product.

- An administrator starts by installing the operating system and all desired applications on a computer (labeled as the baseline system in the figure). The administrator then configures the system with relevant security and other settings to meet the organization's needs. Personnel then perform extensive testing to ensure that the system operates as expected before proceeding to the next step. FIGURE 16.2 Creating and deploying images

- Next, the administrator captures an image of the system using imaging software and stores it on a server (labeled as an Image Server in the figure). It's also possible to store images on external hard drives, USB drives, or DVDs.

- Personnel then deploy the image to systems as needed. These systems often require additional configuration to finalize them, such as giving them unique names. However, the overall configuration of these systems is the same as the baseline system.

Baseline images improve the security of systems by ensuring that desired security settings are always configured correctly. Additionally, they reduce the amount of time required to deploy and maintain systems, thus reducing the overall maintenance costs. Deployment of a prebuilt image can require only a few minutes of a technician's time. If a user's system becomes corrupt, technicians can redeploy an image in minutes, instead of taking hours to troubleshoot the system or trying to rebuild it from scratch.

Organizations typically protect the baseline images to ensure that they aren't modified. In a worst-case scenario, malware can be injected into an image and then deployed to systems within the network.

### Automation

It's common to combine imaging with other automated methods for baselines. In other words, administrators can create one image for all desktop computers within an organization. They then use automated methods to add additional applications, features, or settings for specific groups of computers. For example, computers in one department may have additional security settings or applications applied through scripting or other automated tools.

Microsoft's operating systems include Group Policy. Administrators can configure a Group Policy setting one time and automatically have the setting apply to all the computers in the domain. Other Group Policy settings can be configured to apply to all computers in a group, such as all file servers or all the accounting department's computers.

It's becoming common to make registry changes for some Windows systems. As an example, attackers are using PowerShell in offensive attacks quite often. Chapter 14 discusses PowerShell's use in privilege escalation attacks. By modifying some registry settings, administrators limit these attacksâ€™ effectiveness and detect them when they start. Some settings prevent an attacker from accessing PowerShell, and other settings enable additional logging so that administrators can see what the attackers are doing with PowerShell. Administrators can manipulate Group Policy settings to modify the appropriate registry settings.
