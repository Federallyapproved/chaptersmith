## The Elements of This Study Guide

Each chapter includes common elements to help you focus your studies and test your knowledge. Here are descriptions of those elements:

- Real-World Scenarios As you work through each chapter, you'll find descriptions of typical and plausible workplace situations where an understanding of the security strategies and approaches relevant to the chapter content could play a role in fixing problems or in fending off potential difficulties. This gives readers a chance to see how specific security policies, guidelines, or practices should or may be applied to the workplace.

- Tips and Notes Throughout each chapter you will see inserted statements that you should pay additional attention to. These items are often focused details related to the chapter section or related important material.

- Summaries The summary is a brief review of the chapter to sum up what was covered.

- Exam Essentials The Exam Essentials highlight topics that could appear on the exam in some form. Although we obviously do not know exactly what will be included on a particular exam, this section reinforces significant concepts that are key to understanding the concepts and topics of the chapter. The Exam Essentials are the minimum knowledge you want to retain from a chapter.

- Written Labs Each chapter includes written labs that synthesize various concepts and topics that appear in the chapter. These raise questions that are designed to help you put together various pieces you've encountered individually in the chapter and assemble them to propose or describe potential security strategies or solutions. We highly encourage you to write out your answers before viewing our suggested solutions in Appendix B.

- Chapter Review Questions Each chapter includes practice questions that have been designed to measure your knowledge of key ideas that were discussed in the chapter. After you finish each chapter, answer the questions; if some of your answers are incorrect, it's an indication that you need to spend some more time studying the corresponding topics. The answers to the practice questions can be found in Appendix A.
