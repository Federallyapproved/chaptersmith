## Chapter 17: Preventing and Responding to Incidents

- An incident is any event that has a negative effect on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's assets.

- Incident management steps listed in the CISSP Security Operations domain are detection, response, mitigation, reporting, recovery, remediation, and lessons learned.

- Intrusion detection systems are described as host based or network based, knowledge based or behavior based, and passive or active. Host-based IDSs examine events on individual computers in great detail, including file activities, accesses, and processes. Network-based IDSs examine general network events and anomalies through traffic evaluation. A knowledge-based IDS uses a database of known attacks to detect intrusions. A behavior-based IDS starts with a baseline of normal activity and measures network activity against the baseline to identify abnormal activity. A passive response will log the activity and often provide a notification. An active response directly responds to the intrusion to stop or block the attack.

- A SIEM system collects log entries from multiple sources in a centralized application. It can accept data from dissimilar devices and correlate and aggregate all of the data into useful information. It can also be configured to send alerts in real time to specific items of interest.

- Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) refers to a group of technologies that automatically respond to some incidents. This reduces the workload on administrators.
