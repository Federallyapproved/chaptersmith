## Objective Map

This book is designed to cover each of the eight CISSP Common Body of Knowledge domains in sufficient depth to provide you with a clear understanding of the material. The main body of this book consists of 21 chapters. Here is a complete CISSP Exam Outline mapping each objective item to its location in this book's chapters.
