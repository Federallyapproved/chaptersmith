# Foreword

Welcome to the (ISC) 2速 CISSP 速 Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 9th Edition .

Data from the 2020 Cybersecurity Workforce Study shows that 47 percent of employers require their security staff to hold vendor-neutral cybersecurity certifications and that the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is the most commonly held.

According to the study, employers value certified cybersecurity professionals for a number of qualities, from having increased confidence in strategies and practices to communicating and demonstrating that confidence and competence to customers. Other benefits of certification cited by employers include reducing the impact of a security breach, knowing that technology and best practices are up to date, and enhancing the organization's reputation within its given industry.

In addition to engendering confidence on the part of their employers and organizations, security professionals with cybersecurity certifications can boost their salaries by 27 percent on average. There has never been a better time to use your information technology skills to help protect your organization's infrastructure, information, systems, and processes and to improve and grow in your professional journey.

The CISSP certification is the gold standard for mastery in the field of cybersecurity, demonstrating to employers that you have strong knowledge and skills within a broad range of cybersecurity disciplines and an ability to build and manage nearly all aspects of an organization's security operations. It also signals your commitment to ongoing professional development as you continue to stay abreast of industry changes and sharpen your skills.

This study guide will steer you through the eight subject area domains on which the CISSP exam will test your knowledge. Step by step, it will cover the fundamentals involved in each topic and gradually build toward more focused areas of learning to prepare you, based on the content covered in the (ISC) 2 CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK).

As you prepare to sit for the CISSP exam, this guide will help you build a solid understanding of concepts of design, implementation, and management of best-in-class cybersecurity programs, as well as the ethical fidelity required of CISSP holders.

I hope that you will find the (ISC) 2速 CISSP 速 Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 9th Edition helpful in your cybersecurity journey, exam preparation, and continued professional growth.

Sincerely,

Clar Rosso

CEO, (ISC) 2
