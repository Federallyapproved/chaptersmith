## Chapter 20: Software Development Security

- The primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table. For example, an employee identification number might be the primary key for a table containing information about employees.

- Polyinstantiation is a database security technique that appears to permit the insertion of multiple rows sharing the same uniquely identifying information.

- Static analysis performs assessment of the code itself, analyzing the sequence of instructions for security flaws. Dynamic analysis tests the code in a live production environment, searching for runtime flaws.

- Static and dynamic analysis each have the potential to uncover different types of security and design flaws. When the testers have access to the application code, they should conduct both static and dynamic testing. Reading code is a lot different from executing it!

- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques both use training datasets to develop models, but they differ in the nature and use of those training datasets. In supervised techniques, the instances use labeled data that contains the correct answers that the model should learn how to apply to future instances. In unsupervised techniques, the data is not labeled and the algorithm is asked to identify those labels as part of the learning process.
