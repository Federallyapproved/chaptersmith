## Chapter 10: Physical Security Requirements

- C. Natural training and enrichment is not a core strategy of CPTED. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) has three main strategies: natural access control, natural surveillance, and natural territorial reinforcement. Natural access control is the subtle guidance of those entering and leaving a building through placement of entranceways, use of fences and bollards, and placement of lights. Natural surveillance is any means to make criminals feel uneasy through the increasing of opportunities for them to be observed. Natural territorial reinforcement is the attempt to make the area feel like an inclusive, caring community.

- B. Critical path analysis is a systematic effort to identify relationships between mission-critical applications, processes, and operations and all the necessary supporting elements when evaluating the security of a facility or designing a new facility. Log file audit can help detect violations to hold users accountable, but it is not a security facility design element. Risk analysis is often involved in facility design, but it is the evaluation of threats against assets in regard to rate of occurrence and levels of consequence. Taking inventory is an important part of facility and equipment management, but it is not an element in overall facility design.

- A, C, F. The true statements are option A, cameras should be positioned to watch exit and entry points allowing any change in authorization or access level; option C, cameras should be positioned to have clear sight lines of all exterior walls, entrance and exit points, and interior hallways; and option F, some camera systems include a system on a chip (SoC) or embedded components and may be able to perform various specialty functions, such as time-lapse recording, tracking, facial recognition, object detection, or infrared or color-filtered recording. The remaining answer options are incorrect. The corrected statements for those options are: option B: Cameras should also be used to monitor activities around valuable assets and resources as well as to provide additional protection in public areas such as parking structures and walkways; option D: Security cameras can be overt and obvious in order to provide a deterrent benefit, or hidden and concealed in order to primarily provide a detective benefit; option E: Some cameras are fixed, whereas others support remote control of automated pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ); and option G: Simple motion recognition or motion-triggered cameras may be fooled by animals, birds, insects, weather, or foliage.

- D. Equal access to all locations within a facility is not a security-focused design element. Each area containing assets or resources of different importance, value, and confidentiality should have a corresponding level of security restriction placed on it. A secure facility should have a separation between work and visitor areas and should restrict access to areas with higher value or importance, and confidential assets should be located in the heart or center of a facility.

- A. A computer room does not need to be optimized for human workers to be efficient and secure. A server room would be more secure with a nonwater fire suppressant system (it would protect against damage caused by water suppressant). A server room should have humidity maintained between 20 and 80 percent relative humidity and maintain a temperature between 59 and 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

- C. Hashing is not a typical security measure implemented in relation to a media storage facility containing reusable removable media. Hashing is used when it is necessary to verify the integrity of a dataset, whereas data on reusable removable media should be removed and not retained. Usually the security features for a media storage facility include using a media librarian or custodian, using a check-in/check-out process, and using sanitization tools on returned media.

- B. The humidity in a computer room should ideally be from 20 to 80 percent. Humidity above 80 percent can result in condensation, which causes corrosion. Humidity below 20 percent can result in increased static electricity buildup. However, this does require managing temperature properly as well. The other number ranges are not the relative humidity ranges recommended for a data center.

- B, C, E, F, H. The primary elements of a cable plant management policy should include a mapping of the entrance facility (i.e., demarcation point), equipment room, backbone distribution system, telecommunications room, and horizontal distribution system. The other items are not elements of a cable plant. Thus, access control vestibule, fire escapes, UPSs, and the loading dock are not needed elements on a cable map.

- C. A preaction system is the best type of water-based fire suppression system for a computer facility because it provides the opportunity to prevent the release of water in the event of a false alarm or false initial trigger. The other options of wet pipe, dry pipe, and deluge system use only a single trigger mechanism without the ability to prevent accidental water release.

- B. The most common cause of a false positive for a water-based system is human error. If you turn off the water source after a fire and forget to turn it back on, you'll be in trouble for the future. Also, pulling an alarm when there is no fire will trigger damaging water release throughout the office. Water shortage would be a problem, but it is not a cause for a false positive event. Ionization detectors are highly reliable, so they are usually not the cause of a false positive event. Detectors can be placed in drop ceilings in order to monitor that air space; this would only be a problem if another detector was not placed in the main area of the room. If there are only detectors in the drop ceiling, then that could result in a false negative event.

- D. The cause of the hardware failures is implied by the lack of organization of the equipment, which is heat buildup. This could be addressed by better management of temperature and airflow, which would involve implementing hot aisles and cold aisles in the data center. A data center should have few if any actual visitors (such as outsiders), but anyone entering and leaving a data center should be tracked and recorded in a log. However, whether or not a visitor log is present has little to do with system failure due to poor heat management. Industrial camouflage is not relevant here since it is about hiding the purpose of a facility from outside observers. A gas-based fire suppression system is more appropriate for a data center than a water-based system, but neither would cause heat problems due to poor system organization.

- B, C, D. Benefits of gas-based fire suppression include causing the least damage to computer systems and extinguishing the fire quickly by removing oxygen. Also, gas-based fire suppression may be more effective and faster than a water-based system. A gas-based fire suppression system can only be used where human presence is at a minimum, since it removes oxygen from the air.

- B. The correct order of the six common physical security control mechanisms is Deter, Deny, Detect, Delay, Determine, Decide. The other options are incorrect.

- C. Mean time to failure (MTTF) is the expected typical functional lifetime of the device given a specific operating environment. Mean time to repair (MTTR) is the average length of time required to perform a repair on the device. Mean time between failures (MTBF) is an estimation of the time between the first and any subsequent failures. A service level agreement (SLA) clearly defines the response time a vendor will provide in the event of an equipment failure emergency.

- C. Human safety is the most important goal of all security solutions. The top priority of security should always be the protection of the lives and safety of personnel. The protection of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) of company data and other assets is the second priority after human life and safety.

- C. An access control vestibule is a double set of doors that is often protected by a guard and used to contain a subject until their identity and authentication is verified. A gate is a doorway used to traverse through a fence line. A turnstile is an ingress or egress point that allows travel only in one direction and by one person at a time. A proximity detector determines whether a proximity device is nearby and whether the bearer is authorized to access the area being protected.

- D. Lighting is often claimed to be the most commonly deployed physical security mechanism. However, lighting is only a deterrent and not a strong deterrent. It should not be used as the primary or sole protection mechanism except in areas with a low threat level. Your entire site, inside and out, should be well lit. This provides for easy identification of personnel and makes it easier to notice intrusions. Security guards are not as common as lighting, but they are more flexible in terms of security benefits. Fences are not as common as lighting, but they serve as a preventive control. CCTV is not as common as lighting but serves as a detection control.

- A. Security guards are usually unaware of the scope of the operations within a facility and are therefore not thoroughly equipped to know how to respond to every situation. Though this is considered a disadvantage, the lack of knowledge of the scope of the operations within a facility can also be considered an advantage because this supports confidentiality of those operations and thus helps reduce the possibility that a security guard will be involved in the disclosure of confidential information. Thus, even though this answer option is ambiguous, it is still better than the three other options. The other three options are disadvantages of security guards. Not all environments and facilities support security guards. This may be because of actual human incompatibility or the layout, design, location, and construction of the facility. Not all security guards are themselves reliable. Prescreening, bonding, and training do not guarantee that you won't end up with an ineffective or unreliable security guard.

- C. Key locks are the most common and inexpensive form of physical access control device for both interior and exterior use. Lighting, security guards, and fences are all much more costly. Fences are also mostly used outdoors.

- D. A capacitance motion detector senses changes in the electrical or magnetic field surrounding a monitored object. A wave pattern motion detector transmits a consistent low ultrasonic or high microwave frequency signal into a monitored area and monitors for significant or meaningful changes or disturbances in the reflected pattern. A photoelectric motion detector senses changes in visible light levels for the monitored area. Photoelectric motion detectors are usually deployed in internal rooms that have no windows and are kept dark. An infrared PIR (passive infrared) or heat-based motion detector monitors for significant or meaningful changes in the heat levels and patterns in a monitored area.
