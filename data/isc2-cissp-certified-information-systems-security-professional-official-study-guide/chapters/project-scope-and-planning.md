## Project Scope and Planning

As with any formalized business process, the development of a resilient business continuity plan requires the use of a proven methodology. Organizations should approach the planning process with several goals in mind:

- Perform a structured review of the business's organization from a crisis planning point of view.

- Create a BCP team with the approval of senior management.

- Assess the resources available to participate in business continuity activities.

- Analyze the legal and regulatory landscape that governs an organization's response to a catastrophic event.

The exact process you use will depend on the size and nature of your organization and its business. There isn't a “one-size-fits-all” guide to business continuity project planning. You should consult with project planning professionals in your organization and determine the approach that will work best within your organizational culture.

The purpose of this phase is to ensure that the organization dedicates sufficient time and attention to both developing the project scope and plan and then documenting those activities for future reference.

### Organizational Review

One of the first responsibilities of the individuals responsible for business continuity planning is to perform an analysis of the business organization to identify all departments and individuals who have a stake in the BCP process. Here are some areas to consider:

- Operational departments that are responsible for the core services the business provides to its clients

- Critical support services, such as the IT department, facilities and maintenance personnel, and other groups responsible for the upkeep of systems that support the operational departments

- Corporate security teams responsible for physical security, since they are many times the first responders to an incident and are also responsible for the physical safeguarding of the primary facility and alternate processing facility

- Senior executives and other key individuals essential for the ongoing viability of the organization

This identification process is critical for two reasons. First, it provides the groundwork necessary to help identify potential members of the BCP team (see the next section). Second, it builds the foundation for the remainder of the BCP process.

Typically, the individuals spearheading the BCP effort perform the business organization analysis. Some organizations employ a dedicated business continuity manager to lead these efforts, whereas others treat it as a part-time responsibility for another IT leader. Either approach is acceptable because the output of the analysis commonly guides the selection of the remaining BCP team members. However, a thorough review of this analysis should be one of the first tasks assigned to the full BCP team when it convenes. This step is critical because the individuals performing the initial analysis may have overlooked critical business functions known to BCP team members that represent other parts of the organization. If the team were to continue without revising the organizational analysis, the entire BCP process might be negatively affected, resulting in the development of a plan that does not fully address the emergency-response needs of the organization as a whole.

When developing a business continuity plan, be sure to consider the location of both your headquarters and any branch offices. The plan should account for a disaster that occurs at any location where your organization conducts its business, including your own physical locations and those of your cloud service providers.

### BCP Team Selection

In some organizations, the IT and/or security departments bear sole responsibility for business continuity planning, and no other operational or support departments provide input. Those departments may not even know of the plan's existence until a disaster looms on the horizon or actually strikes the organization. This is a critical flaw! The isolated development of a business continuity plan can spell disaster in two ways. First, the plan itself may not take into account knowledge possessed only by the individuals responsible for the day-to-day operation of the business. Second, it keeps operational elements “in the dark” about plan specifics until implementation becomes necessary. These two factors may lead to disengaged units disagreeing with provisions of the plan and failing to implement it properly. They also deny organizations the benefits achieved by a structured training and testing program for the plan.

To prevent these situations from adversely impacting the BCP process, the individuals responsible for the effort should take special care when selecting the BCP team. The team should include, at a minimum, the following individuals:

- Representatives from each of the organization's departments responsible for the core services performed by the business

- Business unit team members from the functional areas identified by the organizational analysis

- IT subject-matter experts with technical expertise in areas covered by the BCP

- Cybersecurity team members with knowledge of the BCP process

- Physical security and facility management teams responsible for the physical plant

- Attorneys familiar with corporate legal, regulatory, and contractual responsibilities

- Human resources team members who can address staffing issues and the impact on individual employees

- Public relations team members who need to conduct similar planning for how they will communicate with stakeholders and the public in the event of a disruption

- Senior management representatives with the ability to set the vision, define priorities, and allocate resources

# Tips for Selecting an Effective BCP Team

Select your team carefully! You need to strike a balance between representing different points of view and creating a team with explosive personality differences. Your goal should be to create a group that is as diverse as possible and still operates in harmony.

Take some time to think about the BCP team membership and who would be appropriate for your organization's technical, financial, and political environment. Who would you include?

Each team member brings a unique perspective to the BCP process and will have individual biases. For example, representatives from operational departments will often consider their department the most critical to the organization's continued viability. Although these biases may at first seem divisive, the leader of the BCP effort should embrace them and harness them productively. If used effectively, the biases will help achieve a healthy balance in the final plan as each representative advocates the needs of their department. On the other hand, without effective leadership, these biases may devolve into destructive turf battles that derail the BCP effort and harm the organization as a whole.

# Senior Management and BCP

The role of senior management in the BCP process varies widely from organization to organization. It depends on the culture of the business, management interest in the plan, and the regulatory environment. Critical roles played by senior management usually include setting priorities, providing staff and financial resources, and arbitrating disputes about the criticality (i.e., relative importance) of services.

One of the authors recently completed a BCP consulting engagement with a large nonprofit institution. At the beginning of the engagement, he had a chance to sit down with one of the organization's senior executives to discuss his goals and objectives for their work together. During that meeting, the senior executive asked the consultant, “Is there anything you need from me to complete this engagement?”

The senior executive must have expected a perfunctory response because his eyes widened when the consultant said, “Well, as a matter of fact… .” The executive then learned that his active participation in the process was critical to its success.

When working on a business continuity plan, the BCP team leader must seek and obtain as active a role as possible from a senior executive. Visible senior-level support conveys the importance of the BCP process to the entire organization. It also fosters the active participation of individuals who might write BCP off as a waste of time that they might otherwise spend on operational activities. Furthermore, laws and regulations might require the active participation of those senior leaders in the planning process. If you work for a publicly traded company, you may want to remind executives that courts may find the officers and directors of the firm personally liable if a disaster cripples the business after they failed to exercise due diligence in their contingency planning.

You may also have to convince management that BCP and DRP spending are not a discretionary expense. Management's fiduciary responsibilities to the organization's shareholders require them to at least ensure that adequate BCP measures are in place.

In the case of this BCP engagement, the executive acknowledged the importance of his support and agreed to participate. He sent an email to all employees introducing the effort and stating that it had his full backing. He also attended several of the high-level planning sessions and mentioned the effort in an organization-wide “town hall” meeting.

### Resource Requirements

After the team validates the organizational review, it should turn to an assessment of the resources required by the BCP effort. This assessment involves the resources needed by three distinct BCP phases:

- BCP Development The BCP team will require some resources to perform the four elements of the BCP process (project scope and planning, business impact analysis, continuity planning, and approval and implementation). It's more than likely that the major resource consumed by this BCP phase will be effort expended by members of the BCP team and the support staff they call on to assist in the development of the plan.

- BCP Testing, Training, and Maintenance The testing, training, and maintenance phases of BCP will require some hardware and software commitments. Still, once again, the major commitment in this phase will be the effort of the employees involved in those activities.

- BCP Implementation When a disaster strikes and the BCP team deems it necessary to conduct a full-scale implementation of the business continuity plan, the implementation will require significant resources. Those resources include a large amount of effort (BCP will likely become the focus of a large part, if not all, of the organization) as well as direct financial expenses. For this reason, the team must use its BCP implementation powers judiciously yet decisively.

An effective business continuity plan requires the expenditure of significant resources, ranging from the purchase and deployment of redundant computing facilities to the pencils and paper used by team members scratching out the first drafts of the plan. However, as you saw earlier, personnel are one of the most significant resources consumed by the BCP process. Many security professionals overlook the importance of accounting for labor, but you can rest assured that senior management will not. Business leaders are keenly aware of the effect that time-consuming side activities have on the operational productivity of their organizations and the real cost of personnel in terms of salary, benefits, and lost opportunities. These concerns become especially paramount when you are requesting the time of senior executives.

You should expect that leaders responsible for resource utilization management will put your BCP proposal under a microscope, and you should prepare to defend the necessity of your plan with coherent, logical arguments that address the business case for BCP.

### Real World Scenario

### Explaining the Benefits of BCP

At a recent conference, one of the authors discussed business continuity planning with the chief information security officer (CISO) of a health system from a medium-sized U.S. city. The CISO's attitude was shocking. His organization had not conducted a formal BCP process, and he was confident that an informal approach would work fine in the unlikely event of a disaster.

This attitude is one of the most common arguments against committing resources to BCP. In many organizations, the attitude that the business has always survived, and the key leaders will figure something out in the event of a disaster, pervades corporate thinking. If you encounter this objection, you might want to point out to management the costs that will be incurred by the business (both direct costs and the indirect cost of lost opportunities) for each day that the business is down. Then ask them to consider how long a disorganized recovery might take when compared to an orderly, planned continuity of operations (COOP).

Conducting a formal BCP effort is particularly important in healthcare organizations, where the unavailability of systems could have life-or-death consequences. In October 2020, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert notifying healthcare organizations of an outbreak of ransomware activity specifically targeting their work. Strong continuity plans play an essential role in defending against these availability attacks.

### Legal and Regulatory Requirements

Many industries may find themselves bound by federal, state, and local laws or regulations that require them to implement various degrees of BCP. We've already discussed one example in this chapter—the officers and directors of publicly traded firms have a fiduciary responsibility to exercise due diligence in the execution of their business continuity duties. In other circumstances, the requirements (and consequences of failure) might be even more severe. Emergency services, such as police, fire, and emergency medical operations, have a responsibility to the community to continue operations in the event of a disaster. Indeed, their services become even more critical in an emergency that threatens public safety. Failure to implement an effective BCP could result in the loss of life or property and decrease public confidence in the government.

In many countries, financial institutions, such as banks, brokerages, and the firms that process their data, are subject to strict government and international banking and securities regulations. These regulations are necessarily strict because their purpose is to ensure the continued operation of the institution as a crucial part of the economy. When pharmaceutical manufacturers must produce products in less-than-optimal circumstances following a disaster or in response to a rapidly emerging pandemic, they are required to certify the purity of their products to government regulators. There are countless other examples of industries that are necessary to continue operating in the event of an emergency by various laws and regulations.

Even if you're not bound by any of these considerations, you might have contractual obligations to your clients that require you to implement sound BCP practices. If your contracts include commitments to customers expressed as service-level agreements (SLAs), you might find yourself in breach of those contracts if a disaster interrupts your ability to service your clients. Many clients may feel sorry for you and want to continue using your products/ services, but their own business requirements might force them to sever the relationship and find new suppliers.

On the flip side of the coin, developing a strong, documented business continuity plan can help your organization win new clients and additional business from existing clients. If you can show your customers the sound procedures you have in place to continue serving them in the event of a disaster, they'll place greater confidence in your firm and might be more likely to choose you as their preferred vendor. That's not a bad position to be in!

All of these concerns point to one conclusion—it's essential to include your organization's legal counsel in the BCP process. They are intimately familiar with the legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations that apply to your organization. They can help your team implement a plan that meets those requirements while ensuring the continued viability of the organization to the benefit of all—employees, shareholders, suppliers, and customers alike.

Laws regarding computing systems, business practices, and disaster management change frequently. They also vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Be sure to keep your attorneys involved throughout the lifetime of your BCP, including the testing and maintenance phases. If you restrict their involvement to a pre-implementation review of the plan, you may not become aware of the impact that changing laws and regulations have on your corporate responsibilities.
