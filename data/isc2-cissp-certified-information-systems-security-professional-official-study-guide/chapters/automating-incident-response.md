## Automating Incident Response

Incident response automation has improved considerably over the years, and it continues to improve. The following sections describe some of these improvements, such as security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), artificial intelligence (AI), and threat intelligence techniques.

### Understanding SOAR

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) refers to a group of technologies that allow organizations to respond to some incidents automatically. Organizations have a variety of tools that warn about potential incidents. Traditionally, security administrators respond to each warning manually. This typically requires them to verify the warning is valid and then respond. Many times, they perform the same rote actions that they've done before.

As an example, imagine attackers have launched a SYN flood attack on servers in a screened subnet (sometimes referred to as a demilitarized zone). Network tools detect the attack and raise alerts. The organization has policies in place where security administrators verify the alerts are valid. If so, they manually change the amount of time a server will wait for an ACK packet. After the attack has stopped, they manually change the time back to its original setting.

Depending on the event, it can raise an alarm for an administrator or take some other action. For example, if an email server's send queue starts backing up, a SIEM application can detect the issue and alert administrators before the problem is serious.

SOAR allows security administrators to define these incidents and the response, typically using playbooks and runbooks:

- Playbook A playbook is a document or checklist that defines how to verify an incident. Additionally, it gives details on the response. A playbook for the SYN flood attack would list the same actions security administrators take to verify a SYN flood is under way. It would also list the steps administrators take after verifying it is a SYN flood attack.

- Runbook A runbook implements the playbook data into an automated tool. For example, if an IDS alerts on the traffic, it implements a set of conditional steps to verify that the traffic is a SYN flood attack using the playbook's criteria. If the IDS confirms the attack, it then performs specified actions to mitigate the threat.

It's worth noting that there aren't definitive definitions of a playbook and a runbook that all companies use. For example, some BCP experts say that a runbook refers to computers and networks, whereas a playbook refers to the business in general. However, within the context of incident response, a playbook is a document that defines actions, and the runbook implements those actions.

This scenario shows a single attack and response, but SOAR technologies can respond to any attacks. The hard part is documenting all known incidents and responses in the playbooks and then configuring tools to respond automatically.

It's important to realize that the playbooksâ€™ primary purpose is to document what the runbooks should do. However, playbooks can be used as a manual backup if the SOAR system fails. In other words, if a runbook fails to run after an incident, administrators can still refer to the playbook to complete the steps manually.

### Machine Learning and AI Tools

Many companies (especially those with something to sell) use the terms artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) interchangeably, as though they are synonymous. However, they aren't. Unfortunately, there aren't strict definitions of these terms that everyone agrees on and follows. Marketers may use them synonymously. Scientists creating ML and AI systems have much more complex definitions that have morphed over time. However, the following bullets provide general descriptions of the term:

- Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence and refers to a system that can improve automatically through experience. ML gives computer systems the ability to learn.

- Artificial intelligence is a broad field that includes ML. It gives machines the ability to do things that a human can do better or allows a machine to perform tasks that we previously thought required human intelligence. This is a moving target, though. The idea of a car parking itself or coming to you from a parking spot was once thought to require human intelligence. Cars can now do these tasks without human interaction.

A key point is that machine learning is a part of the broad topic of AI. From a simple perspective, consider machine learning and AI applied to the game of Go.

A machine-learning algorithm will outline the rules of the game, such as how the pieces move, legal moves, and what a win looks like. The machine will use these rules to play games against itself repeatedly. With each game, it adds to its experience level, and it progressively gets better and better. Over time, it learns what strategies work and what strategies don't work.

In contrast, an AI system starts with zero knowledge of the game. It doesn't know how the pieces move, what moves are legal, or even what a win looks like. However, a separate algorithm outside of the AI system enforces the rules. It tells the AI system when it makes an illegal move and when it wins or loses a game. The AI system uses this feedback to create its own algorithms as it is learning the rules. As it creates these algorithms, it applies machine-learning techniques to teach itself winning strategies.

These two examples demonstrate the major difference between machine learning and AI. A machine-learning system (part of AI) starts with a set of rules or guidelines. An AI system starts with nothing and progressively learns the rules. It then creates its own algorithms as it learns the rules and applies machine-learning techniques based on these rules.

Think of a behavior-based detection system as one way machine learning and artificial intelligence can apply to cybersecurity. As a reminder, administrators need to create a baseline of normal activities and traffic on a network. If the network is modified, administrators need to re-create the baseline. In this case, the baseline is similar to a set of rules given to a machine-learning system.

A machine-learning system would use this baseline as a starting point. During normal operation, it detects anomalies and reports them. If an administrator investigates and reports it as a false positive, the machine-learning system learns from this feedback. It modifies the initial baseline based on feedback it receives about valid alarms and false positives.

An AI system starts without a baseline. Instead, it monitors traffic and slowly creates its own baseline based on the traffic it observes. As it creates the baseline, it also looks for anomalies. An AI system also relies on feedback from administrators to learn if alarms are valid or false positives.

### Threat Intelligence

Threat intelligence refers to gathering data on potential threats. It includes using various sources to get timely information on current threats. Many organizations used it to hunt out threats.

#### Understanding the Kill Chain

The military has used a kill chain model to disrupt attacks for decades. The military model has a lot of depth, but in short, it includes the following phases:

- Find or identify a target through reconnaissance.

- Get the target's location.

- Track the target's movement.

- Select a weapon to use on the target.

- Engage the target with the selected weapon.

- Evaluate the effectiveness of the attack.

It's important to know that the military uses this model for both offense and defense. When attacking, they go through each of the phases as an ordered chain of events. However, they know that the enemy is likely using a similar model, so they attempt to break the chain. If the attacker fails at any stage of the attack chain, the attack will not succeed.

Several organizations have adapted the military kill chain to create cyber kill chain models. For example, Lockheed Martin created the Cyber Kill Chain framework. It includes seven ordered stages of an attack:

- Reconnaissance. Attackers gather information on the target.

- Weaponization. Attackers identify an exploit that the target is vulnerable to, along with methods to send the exploit.

- Delivery. Attackers send the weapon to the target via phishing attacks, malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or other common social engineering methods.

- Exploitation. The weapon exploits a vulnerability on the target system.

- Installation. Code that exploits the vulnerability then installs malware. The malware typically includes a backdoor, allowing the target to access the system remotely.

- Command and Control. Attackers maintain a command and control system, which controls the target and other compromised systems.

- Actions on objectives. Attackers execute their original goals such as theft of money, theft of data, data destruction, or installing additional malicious code such as ransomware.

As with the military model, the goal is to disrupt the chain by stopping the attacker at any phase of the attack. As an example, if users avoid all the social engineering methods, the attacker can't deliver the weapon, and the attacker can't succeed.

#### Understanding the MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK Matrix (created by MITRE and viewable at attack.mitre.org ) is a knowledge base of identified tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers in various attacks. It is complementary to kill chain models, such as the Cyber Kill Chain. However, unlike kill chain models, the tactics are not an ordered set of attacks. Instead, ATT&CK lists the TTPs within a matrix. Additionally, attackers are constantly modifying their attack methods, so the ATT&CK Matrix is a living document that is updated at least twice a year.

The matrix includes the following tactics:

- Reconnaissance

- Resource development

- Initial access

- Execution

- Persistence

- Privilege escalation

- Defense evasion

- Credential access

- Discovery

- Lateral movement

- Collection

- Command and control

- Exfiltration

- Impact

Each of the tactics includes techniques used by attackers. For example, the Reconnaissance tactic consists of multiple techniques. Clicking any of these takes you to another page describing it, along with mitigation and detection techniques. Some techniques include layers of subtechniques. If you drill down on Reconnaissance, you'll see Vulnerability Scanning under Active Scanning. This documents specific things you can look for to detect unauthorized scans.

Chapter 15 covers vulnerability scans and vulnerability scanners in more depth.

#### Threat Feeds

On the internet, a feed is a steady stream of content that users can scroll through. Users can subscribe to various content, such as news articles, weather, blog content, and more. As an example, Really Simple Syndication (RSS) allows users to subscribe to different content, and a single aggregator collects the content and displays it to users.

A threat feed is a steady stream of raw data related to current and potential threats. However, in its raw form, it can be difficult to extract meaningful data. A threat intelligence feed attempts to extract actionable intelligence from the raw data. Here is some of the information included in a threat intelligence feed:

- Suspicious domains

- Known malware hashes

- Code shared on internet sites

- IP addresses linked to malicious activity

By comparing data in a threat feed with data going to and from the internet, security experts can identify potentially malicious traffic. Imagine an attacker stands up a website and uses it to attempt drive-by downloads of new malware. If an organization detects this website's domain name (or IP address) in incoming or outgoing traffic, it is readily apparent that this is malicious and should be investigated.

Although it's possible to manually cross-check the data from a threat feed with logs tracking incoming and outgoing traffic, this can be quite tedious. Instead, many organizations use an additional tool to cross-check this data automatically.

Some security organizations sell platforms that integrate with threat feeds and automatically provide organizations with the data they need to respond quickly.

#### Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is the process of actively searching for cyber threats in a network. This goes beyond waiting for traditional network tools to detect and report attacks. It starts with the premise that attackers are in the network now, even if none of the preventive and detective controls have detected them and raised warnings. Instead, security professionals aggressively search systems looking for indicators of threats.

As an example, imagine that a threat feed indicates that a botnet has been launching several DDoS attacks recently. It shows the TTPs commonly used to join computers to the botnet. More, it lists the specific things to look for to identify computers joined to this botnet. This might be the existence of specific files, or log entries showing specific traffic into or out of the network. Once administrators know what to look for, it becomes a simple matter to craft scripts to look for these files on all internal computers or to send alerts for any network traffic with log entries matching the threat feed information.

Many years ago, attackers often caused damage almost immediately after entering a network. However, many attackers now attempt to remain in a network as long as possible. As an example, APTs often stay undetected in networks for months.

There isn't a single method used for threat hunting. However, many methods attempt to analyze the phases of an attack and then look for signs of the attack at individual phases. One popular method of threat hunting is to use a kill chain model.

### The Intersection of SOAR, Machine Learning, AI, and Threat Feeds

These technologies are all advancing rapidly, and things are likely to continue improving. As they do so, it is important to see how these concepts are intertwined.

Think of SOAR technologies. These include playbooks that are the written guidelines administrators use to verify and respond to incidents. Personnel then implement these guidelines in runbooks that implement the guidelines. Strictly speaking, these are not using machine learning or AI because someone must implement the guidelines, and the systems don't deviate from these rules. However, computers are great at performing repetitive steps and eliminating human errors, so they are welcomed by most administrators.

IDPSs often send out false positives (an alert indicating a problem where none exists). After implementing SOAR technologies, they will automatically deal with these false positives using the same guidelines documented in the playbook. Of course, the danger arises when an IDPS has false negatives (indicating a problem that has gone undetected by the IDPS). One way to avoid this is to keep IDPSs informed of new threats.

Enter threat feeds. If the SOAR technologies can receive and process the threat feeds, they can ensure all prevention and detection systems know about new threats and automatically respond to them. Compatible threat feeds can keep systems updated in real time. When a threat feed reports a suspicious domain (website), firewalls can immediately block access to it. When new malware hashes are known, IDPSs can monitor incoming traffic looking for these hashes.

Many companies claim that their security solutions leverage machine learning and AI. However, many of their methods are proprietary, so we can't see them. It could be that their systems are using these advanced techniques. They could also have a team of dedicated professionals working around the clock, identifying threats and manually creating runbooks to detect and mitigate the threats. Either way, SOAR technologies are constantly improving and reducing the workload of administrators.
