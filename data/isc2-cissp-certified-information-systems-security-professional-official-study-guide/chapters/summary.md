## Summary

Security governance, management concepts, and principles are inherent elements in a security policy and in solution deployment. They define the basic parameters needed for a secure environment. They also define the goals and objectives that both policy designers and system implementers must achieve in order to create a secure solution.

The primary goals and objectives of security are contained within the CIA Triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality is the principle that objects are not disclosed to unauthorized subjects. Integrity is the principle that objects retain their veracity and are intentionally modified only by authorized subjects. Availability is the principle that authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects.

Other security-related concepts and principles that should be considered and addressed when designing a security policy and deploying a security solution are identification, authentication, authorization, auditing, nonrepudiation, defense in depth, abstraction, data hiding, and encryption.

Security roles determine who is responsible for the security of an organization's assets. Common roles include senior management, security professionals, asset owner, custodian, user, and auditor.

A formalized security policy structure consists of policies, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures. These individual documents are elements essential to the design and implementation of security in any environment. To be effective, the approach to security management must be a top-down approach.

Threat modeling is the security process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed. Threat modeling can be performed as a proactive measure during design and development or as a reactive measure once a product has been deployed. In either case, the process identifies the potential harm, the probability of occurrence, the priority of concern, and the means to eradicate or reduce the threat.

Integrating cybersecurity risk management with supply chain, acquisition strategies, and business practices is a means to ensure a more robust and successful security strategy in organizations of all sizes. When purchases are made without security considerations, the risks inherent in those products remain throughout their deployment life span.
