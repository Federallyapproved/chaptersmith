## Chapter 4: Laws, Regulations, and Compliance

- The two key mechanisms used to facilitate information transfers are standard contractual clauses (SCCs) and binding corporate rules (BCRs). In the past, organizations could rely on the EU/US Privacy Shield safe harbor agreement, but this agreement was deemed invalid by the European Court of Justice.

- Some common questions that organizations may ask about outsourced service providers are as follows: What types of sensitive information are stored, processed, or transmitted by the vendor? What controls are in place to protect the organization's information? How is your organization's information segregated from that of other clients? If encryption is relied on as a security control, what encryption algorithms and key lengths are used? How is key management handled? What types of security audits does the vendor perform, and what access does the client have to those audits? Does the vendor rely on any other third parties to store, process, or transmit data? How do the provisions of the contract related to security extend to those third parties? Where will data storage, processing, and transmission take place? If outside the home country of the client and/or vendor, what implications does that have? What is the vendor's incident response process and when will clients be notified of a potential security breach? What provisions are in place to ensure the ongoing integrity and availability of client data?

- Some common steps that employers take to notify employees of monitoring include clauses in employment contracts that state the employee should have no expectation of privacy while using corporate equipment, similar written statements in corporate acceptable use and privacy policies, logon banners warning that all communications are subject to monitoring, and labels on computers and telephones warning of monitoring.
