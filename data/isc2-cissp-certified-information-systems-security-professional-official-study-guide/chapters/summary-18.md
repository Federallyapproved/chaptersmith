## Summary

Disaster recovery planning is critical to a comprehensive information security program. DRPs serve as a valuable complement to business continuity plans and ensure that the proper technical controls are in place to keep the business functioning and to restore service after a disruption.

In this chapter, you learned about the different types of natural and human-made disasters that may impact your business. You also explored the types of recovery sites and backup strategies that bolster your recovery capabilities.

An organization's disaster recovery plan is one of the most important documents under the purview of security professionals. It should provide guidance to the personnel responsible for ensuring the continuity of operations in the face of disaster. The DRP provides an orderly sequence of events designed to activate alternate processing sites while simultaneously restoring the primary site to operational status. Once you've successfully developed your DRP, you must train personnel on its use, ensure that you maintain accurate documentation, and conduct periodic tests to keep the plan fresh in the minds of responders.
