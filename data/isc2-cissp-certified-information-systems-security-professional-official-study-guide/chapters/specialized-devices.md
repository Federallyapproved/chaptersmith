## Specialized Devices

The realm of specialized equipment is vast and is always expanding. Specialized equipment is anything designed for one specific purpose, to be used by a specific type of organization, or to perform a specific function. They may be considered a type of DCS, IoT, smart device, endpoint device, or edge computing system. Some common examples of specialized devices are medical equipment, smart vehicles, autonomous aircraft, and smart meters.

A growing number of medical systems are specialized devices that have been integrated with IoT technology to make them remotely accessible for monitoring and management. This may be a great innovation for medical treatment, but it also has security risks. All computer systems are subject to attack and abuse. All computer systems have faults and failings that can be discovered and abused by an attacker. Although most medical device vendors strive to provide robust and secure products, it is not possible to consider and test for every possibility of attack, access, or abuse. There have already been several instances of medical devices being remotely controlled, disabled, accessed, or attacked with a DoS. When using any medical device, consider whether remote access, wired or wireless, is essential to the medical care it is providing. If not, it may still make sense to disable the network feature of the medical device. Although the breach of a personal computer or smartphone may be inconvenient and/or embarrassing, the breach of a medical device can be life-threatening.

In-vehicle computing systems can include the components used to monitor engine performance and optimize braking, steering, and suspension but can also include in-dash elements related to driving, environment controls, and entertainment. Early in-vehicle systems were static environments with little or no ability to be adjusted or changed, especially by the owner/driver. Modern in-vehicle systems may offer a wider range of capabilities, including linking a mobile device or running custom apps. In-vehicle computing systems may or may not have sufficient security mechanisms. Even if the system is only providing information, such as engine performance, entertainment, and navigation, it is important to consider what, if any, security features are included in the solution. Does it connect to cloud services? Are communications encrypted? How strong is the authentication? Is it easily accessible to unauthorized third parties? If the in-vehicle computing system is controlling the vehicle, which might be called automated driving or self-driving, it is even more important that security be a major design element of the system. Otherwise, a vehicle can be converted from a convenient means of transference to a box of death.

Automated pilot systems have been part of aircraft for decades. In most of the airplanes that you have flown on, a human pilot was likely only in full control of the craft during takeoff and landing, and not always even then. For most of the flight, the autopilot system was likely in control of the aircraft. The military, law enforcement, and hobbyists have been using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones for years, but usually under remote control. Now, with flight automation systems, drones can take off, fly to a destination, and land fully autonomously. There are even many retail businesses experimenting with, and in some countries implementing, drone delivery of food and/or other packages. The security of automated aircraft, drones, and UAVs is a concern for all of us. Are these systems secure against malware infection, signal disruption, remote control takeover, AI failure, and remote code execution? Does the drone have authenticated connections to the authorized control system? Are the drone's communications encrypted? What will the aircraft do in the event that all contact with the control system is blocked through DoS or signal jamming? A compromised drone could result in the loss of your pizza, a damaged product, a few broken shingles, or severe bodily injury.

A smart meter is a remotely accessible electrical meter. It allows the electricity provider to track energy use remotely. Some smart meters grant the customer the ability to view collected statistics as well. Third-party smart meters can be installed in a building that can identify equipment, appliances, and devices from their energy consumption signatures. These types of smart meters can track energy use by device and provide guidance on minimizing energy consumption.
