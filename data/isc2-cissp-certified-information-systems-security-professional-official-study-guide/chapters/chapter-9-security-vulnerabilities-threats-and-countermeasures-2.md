## Chapter 9: Security Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Countermeasures

- An industrial control system (ICS) is a form of computer-management device that controls industrial processes and machines (aka operational technology). There are several forms of ICS, including distributed control systems (DCSs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). DCS units are typically found in industrial process plants where the need to gather data and implement control over a large-scale environment from a single location is essential. A SCADA system can operate as a standalone device, can be networked together with other SCADA systems, or can be networked with traditional IT systems. A DCS focuses on processes and is state driven, whereas SCADA focuses on data gathering and is event driven. A DCS is used to control processes using a network of sensors, controllers, actuators, and operator terminals and is able to carry out advanced process control techniques. DCS is more suited to operating on a limited scale, whereas SCADA is suitable for managing systems over large geographic areas. PLC units are effectively single-purpose or focused-purpose digital computers. They are typically deployed for the management and automation of various industrial electromechanical operations.

- The three pairs of aspects or features used to describe storage are primary versus secondary, volatile versus nonvolatile, and random versus sequential.

- Some vulnerabilities found in distributed architecture include sensitive data found on desktops/terminals/laptops, lack of security understanding among users, greater risk of physical component theft, compromise of a client leading to the compromise of the whole network, greater risk from malware because of user-installed software and removable media, and data on clients less likely to be included in backups.

- Examples of server-based technologies include large-scale parallel data systems, SMP, AMP, MPP, grid computing, peer-to-peer computing, ICS, DCS, PLC, SCADA, DCE, IoT, IIoT, specialized devices (medical equipment, smart vehicles, autonomous aircraft, and smart meters), microservices, SOA, IaC, SDV, virtualized systems (virtual software, virtual networking, SDN), SDx, SDS, SDDC, VDI, VMI, SDV, XaaS, MaaS, SECaaS, iPaaS, FaaS, ITaaS, containerization, serverless architecture.

- There were 24 potential on-device security features mentioned in this chapter; any seven of the following would be correct: device authentication, full-device encryption, communication protection, remote wiping, device lockout, screen locks, GPS and location services management, content management, application control, push notification management, third-party application store control, storage segmentation, asset tracking and inventory control, removable storage, managing connection methods, disabling unused features, rooting/jailbreaking, sideloading, custom firmware, carrier unlocking, firmware OTA updates, key management, credential management, and text messaging security. Note that MDM/UEM is not an on-device security feature but an external tool used to configure those features. There are four main mobile device deployment models: BYOD, COPE, CYOD, and COMS/COBO. VDI and VMI are alternative means to grant users access to company resources, but they are not mobile device deployment models. There were 17 potential issues that should be addressed on a mobile device deployment policy mentioned in this chapter, and any seven of the following would be correct: data ownership, support ownership, patch and update management, security product management, forensics, privacy, onboarding/offboarding, adherence to corporate policies, user acceptance, architecture/infrastructure considerations, legal concerns, acceptable use policies, onboard cameras/video, recording microphone, Wi-Fi Direct, tethering and hotspots, and contactless payment methods.
