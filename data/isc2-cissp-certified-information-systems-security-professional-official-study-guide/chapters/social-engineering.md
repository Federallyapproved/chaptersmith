## Social Engineering

Social engineering is a form of attack that exploits human nature and human behavior. People are a weak link in security because they can make mistakes, be fooled into causing harm, or intentionally violate company security. Social engineering attacks exploit human characteristics such as a basic trust in others, a desire to provide assistance, or a propensity to show off. It is important to consider the risks that personnel represent to your organization and implement security strategies to minimize and handle those risks.

Social engineering attacks take two primary forms: convincing someone to perform an unauthorized operation or convincing someone to reveal confidential information. In just about every case, in social engineering the attacker tries to convince the victim to perform some activity or reveal a piece of information that they shouldn't. The result of a successful attack is information leakage or the attacker being granted logical or physical access to a secure environment.

Here are some example scenarios of common social engineering attacks:

- A website claims to offer free temporary access to its products and services, but it requires web browser and/or firewall alterations in order to download the access software. These alterations may reduce the security protections or encourage the victim to install malicious browser helper objects (BHOs) (also known as plug-ins, extensions, add-ons).

- The help desk receives a call from someone claiming to be a department manager who is currently involved in a sales meeting in another city. The caller claims to have forgotten their password and needs it to be reset so that they can log in remotely to download an essential presentation.

- Someone who looks like a repair technician claims a service call was received for a malfunctioning device in the building. The “technician” is sure the unit can be accessed from inside your office work area and asks to be given access to repair the system.

- If a worker receives a communication from someone asking to talk with a coworker by name, and there is no such person currently or previously working for the organization, this could be a ruse to either reveal the names of actual employees or convince you to “provide assistance” because the caller has incorrect information.

- When a contact on a discussion forum asks personal questions, such as your education, history, and interests, they could be focused on learning the answers to password reset questions.

Some of these examples may also be legitimate and benign occurrences, but you can see how they could mask the motives and purposes of an attacker. Social engineers attempt to mask and hide their true intentions by crafting their attack to seem as normal and typical as possible.

Whenever a security breach occurs, an investigation should be performed to determine what was affected and whether the attack is ongoing. Personnel should be retrained to detect and avoid similar social engineering attacks in the future. Although social engineering attacks primarily focus on people, the results of an attack can be disclosure of private or confidential materials, physical damage to a facility, or remote access to an IT environment. Therefore, any attempted or successful social engineering breach should be thoroughly investigated and responded to.

Methods to protect against social engineering include the following:

- Training personnel about social engineering attacks and how to recognize common signs

- Requiring authentication when performing activities for personnel over the phone

- Defining restricted information that is never communicated over the phone or through plaintext communications such as standard email

- Always verifying the credentials of a repair person and verifying that a real service call was placed by authorized personnel

- Never following the instructions of an email without verifying the information with at least two independent and trusted sources

- Always erring on the side of caution when dealing with anyone you don't know or recognize, whether in person, over the phone, or over the internet/network

If several workers report the same odd event, such as a call or email, an investigation should look into what the contact was about, who initiated it, and what the intention or purpose was.

The most important defense against social engineering attacks is user education and awareness training. A healthy dose of paranoia and suspicion will help users detect or notice more social engineering attack attempts than without such preparation. Training should include role playing and walking through numerous examples of the various forms of social engineering attacks. However, keep in mind that attackers are constantly altering their approaches and improving their means of attack. So, keeping current with newly discovered means of social engineering attack is also necessary to defend against this human-focused threat.

Users should receive training when they first enter an organization, and they should receive periodic refresher training, even if it's just an email from the administrator or training officer reminding them of the threats.

### Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering works so well because we're human. The principles of social engineering attacks are designed to focus on various aspects of human nature and take advantage of them. Although not every target succumbs to every attack, most of us are vulnerable to one or more of the following common social engineering principles.

#### Authority

Authority is an effective technique because most people are likely to respond to authority with obedience. The trick is to convince the target that the attacker is someone with valid internal or external authority. Some attackers claim their authority verbally, and others assume authority by wearing a costume or uniform.

An example is an email sent using the spoofed email of the CEO in which workers are informed that they must visit a specific universal resource locator (URL)/universal resource indicator (URI) to fill out an important HR document. This method works when the victims blindly follow instructions that claim to be from a person of authority.

#### Intimidation

Intimidation can sometimes be seen as a derivative of the authority principle. Intimidation uses authority, confidence, or even the threat of harm to motivate someone to follow orders or instructions. Often, intimidation is focused on exploiting uncertainty in a situation where a clear directive of operation or response isn't defined.

An example is expanding on a previous CEO and HR document email to include a statement claiming that employees will face a penalty if they do not fill out the form promptly. The penalty could be a loss of casual Friday, exclusion from Taco Tuesday, a reduction in pay, or even termination.

#### Consensus

Consensus or social proof is the act of taking advantage of a person's natural tendency to mimic what others are doing or are perceived as having done in the past. For example, bartenders often seed their tip jar with money to make it seem as if previous patrons were appreciative of the service. As a social engineering principle, the attacker attempts to convince the victim that a particular action or response is necessary to be consistent with social norms or previous occurrences.

An example is an attacker claiming that a worker who is currently out of the office promised a large discount on a purchase and that the transaction must occur now with you as the salesperson.

#### Scarcity

Scarcity is a technique used to convince someone that an object has a higher value based on the object's scarcity. This could relate to the existence of only a few items produced or limited opportunities, or that the majority of stock are sold and only a few items remain.

An example is an attacker claiming that there are only two tickets left to your favorite team's final game and it would be a shame if someone else enjoyed the game rather than you. If you don't grab them now, the opportunity will be lost. This principle is often associated with the principle of urgency.

#### Familiarity

Familiarity or liking as a social engineering principle attempts to exploit a person's native trust in that which is familiar. The attacker often tries to appear to have a common contact or relationship with the target, such as mutual friends or experiences, or uses a facade to take on the identity of another company or person. If the target believes a message is from a known entity, such as a friend or their bank, they're much more likely to trust in the content and even act or respond.

An example is an attacker using a vishing attack while falsifying the caller ID as their doctor's office.

#### Trust

Trust as a social engineering principle involves an attacker working to develop a relationship with a victim. This may take seconds or months, but eventually the attacker attempts to use the value of the relationship (the victim's trust in the attacker) to convince the victim to reveal information or perform an action that violates company security.

An example is an attacker approaching you as you walk along the street, when they appear to pick up a $100 bill from the ground. The attacker says that since the two of you were close when the money was found, you two should split it. They ask if you have change to split the found money. Since the attacker had you hold the money while they went around to find the person who lost it, this might have built up trust in this stranger so that you are willing to take cash out of your wallet and give it to them. But you won't realize until later that the $100 was counterfeit and you've been robbed.

#### Urgency

Urgency often dovetails with scarcity, because the need to act quickly increases as scarcity indicates a greater risk of missing out. Urgency is often used as a method to get a quick response from a target before they have time to carefully consider or refuse compliance.

An example is an attacker using an invoice scam through business email compromise (BEC) to convince you to pay an invoice immediately because either an essential business service is about to be cut off or the company will be reported to a collection agency.

### Eliciting Information

Eliciting information is the activity of gathering or collecting information from systems or people. In the context of social engineering, it is used as a research method in order to craft a more effective pretext. A pretext is a false statement crafted to sound believable in order to convince you to act or respond in favor of the attacker. Any and all of the social engineering techniques covered in this chapter can be used both as a weapon to harm the target victim and as a means to obtain more information (or access). Thus, social engineering is a tool of both reconnaissance and attack. Data gathered via social engineering can be used to support a physical or logical/technical attack.

Any means or method by which a social engineer can gather information from the target is eliciting information. Any fact or truth or detail that can be collected, gathered, or gleaned from the target can be used to form a more complete and believable pretext or false story, which in turn may increase the chance of success of the next level or stage of an attack.

Consider that many cyberattacks are similar to actual warfare attacks. The more the attacker knows about the targeted enemy, the more effectively a plan of attack can be crafted.

Defending against eliciting information events generally involves the same precautions as those used against social engineering. Those include classifying information, controlling the movement of sensitive data, watching for attempted abuses, training personnel, and reporting any suspicious activity to the security team.

### Prepending

Prepending is the adding of a term, expression, or phrase to the beginning or header of some other communication. Often prepending is used in order to further refine or establish the pretext of a social engineering attack, such as spam, hoaxes, and phishing. An attacker can precede the subject of an attack message with RE: or FW: (which indicates “in regard to and forwarded,” respectively) to make the receiver think the communication is the continuance of a previous conversation rather than the first contact of an attack. Other often-used prepending terms are EXTERNAL, PRIVATE, and INTERNAL.

Prepending attacks can also be used to fool filters, such as spam filters, antimalware, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs). This could be accomplished with SAFE, FILTERED, AUTHORIZED, VERIFIED, CONFIRMED, or APPROVED, among others. It might even be possible to interject alternate email header values, such as “X-Spam-Category: LEGIT” or “X-Spam-Condition: SAFE,” which could fool spam and abuse filters.

### Phishing

Phishing is a form of social engineering attack focused on stealing credentials or identity information from any potential target. It is derived from “fishing” for information. Phishing can be waged in numerous ways using a variety of communication media, including email and the web; in face-to-face interactions or over the phone; and even through more traditional communication mediums, such as the post office or couriered packages.

Attackers send phishing emails indiscriminately as spam, without knowing who will get them but in the hope that some users will respond. Phishing emails sometimes inform the user of a bogus problem and say that if the user doesn't take action, the company will lock the user's account. The From email address is often spoofed to look legitimate, but the Reply To email address is an account controlled by the attacker. Sophisticated attacks include a link to a bogus website that looks legitimate but that captures credentials and passes them to the attacker.

Sometimes the goal of phishing is to install malware on user systems. The message may include an infected file attachment or a link to a website that installs a malicious drive-by download without the user's knowledge.

A drive-by download is a type of malware that installs itself without the user's knowledge when the user visits a website. Drive-by downloads take advantage of vulnerabilities in browsers or plug-ins.

To defend against phishing attacks, end users should be trained to do the following:

- Be suspicious of unexpected email messages, or email messages from unknown senders.

- Never open unexpected email attachments.

- Never share sensitive information via email.

- Avoid clicking any link received via email, instant messaging, or a social network message.

If a message claims to be from a known source, such as a website commonly visited, the user should visit the supposed site by using a preestablished bookmark or by searching for the site by name. If, after accessing their account on the site, a duplicate message does not appear in the online messaging or alert system, the original message is likely an attack or a fake. Any such false communications should be reported to the targeted organization, and then the message should be deleted. If the attack relates to your organization or employer, it should be reported to the security team there as well.

Organizations should consider the consequences and increased risk that granting workers access to personal email and social networks through company systems pose. Some companies have elected to block access to personal internet communications while using company equipment or through company-controlled network connections. This reduces the risk to the organization even if an individual succumbs to a phishing attack on their own.

A phishing simulation is a tool used to evaluate the ability of employees to resist or fall for a phishing campaign. A security manager or penetration tester crafts a phishing attack so that any clicks by victims are redirected to a notification that the phishing message was a simulation and they may need to attend additional training to avoid falling for a real attack.

### Spear Phishing

Spear phishing is a more targeted form of phishing where the message is crafted and directed specifically to a group of individuals. Often, attackers use a stolen customer database to send false messages crafted to seem like a communication from the compromised business but with falsified source addresses and incorrect URI/URLs. The hope of the attacker is that someone who already has an online/digital relationship with an organization is more likely to fall for the false communication.

All of the concepts and defenses discussed in the previous section, “Phishing,” apply to spear phishing.

Spear phishing can also be crafted to seem as if it originated from a CEO or other top office in an organization. This version of spear phishing is often call business email compromise (BEC) . BEC is often focused on convincing members of accounting or financial departments to transfer funds or pay invoices based on instructions seeming to originate from a boss, manager, or executive. BEC has defrauded organizations of billions of dollars in the last few years. BEC is also known as CEO fraud or CEO spoofing .

As with most forms of social engineering, defenses for spear phishing require the following:

- Labeling information, data, and assets with their value, importance, or sensitivity

- Training personnel on proper handling of those assets based on their labels

- Requesting clarification or confirmation on any actions that seem abnormal, off-process, or otherwise overly risky to the organization

Some abusive concepts to watch out for are requests to pay bills or invoices using prepaid gift cards, changes to wiring details (especially at the last minute), or requests to purchase products that are atypical for the requester and that are needed in a rush. When seeking to confirm a suspected BEC, do not use the same communication medium that the BEC used. Make a phone call, go to their office, text-message their cell phone, or use the company-approved internal messaging service. Establishing a second “out-of-band” contact with the requester will further confirm whether the message is legitimate or false.

### Whaling

Whaling is a form of spear phishing that targets specific high-value individuals (by title, by industry, from media coverage, and so forth), such as the CEO or other C-level executives, administrators, or high-net-worth clients. Whaling attacks require significantly more research, planning, and development on the part of the attackers in order to fool the victim. That is because these high-level personnel are often well aware that they are a high-value target.

Exam questions do not always use the exact correct term for a specific topic. When the best term for a concept is not used or not present, then see if a broader or more inclusive term might be used instead. For example, if there is mention of an email attack against a CEO that attempted to steal trade secrets but there is no mention of whaling, then you could consider it an example of spear phishing instead. Spear phishing is a broader concept of which whaling is a more specific example or version. There are many child-parent or superset-subset relationships among topics on the CISSP exam. So, watch out for this trick or feature in both practice and exam questions.

### Smishing

Short Message Service (SMS) phishing or smishing (Spam over instant messaging [SPIM]) is a social engineering attack that occurs over or through standard text messaging services. There are several smishing threats to watch out for, including these:

- Text messages asking for a response or reply. In some cases, replies could trigger a cramming event. Cramming is when a false or unauthorized charge is placed onto your mobile service plan.

- Text messages could include a hyperlink/URI/URL to a phishing or scam website or trigger the installation of malicious code.

- Text messages could contain pretexts to get you involved in a conversation.

- Text messages could include phone numbers. Always research a phone number before calling it, especially from an unknown source. There are phone numbers with the same structure as local or domestic numbers but that may actually be long distance and not included in your calling service or plan, and calling them could cause a connection charge and a high per-minute toll charge.

Although smishing refers to SMS-based attacks, it can sometimes be used to refer to similar attacks occurring through Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), Rich Communication Services (RCS), Google Hangouts, Android Messenger, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Apple/iPhone iMessages, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and so on.

### Vishing

Vishing (i.e., voiced-based phishing) or SpIT (Spam over Internet Telephony) is phishing done over any telephony or voice communication system. This includes traditional phone lines, Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services, and mobile phones. Most of the social engineers waging vishing campaigns use VoIP technology to support their attacks. VoIP allows the attacker to be located anywhere in the world, make free phone calls to victims, and be able to falsify or spoof their origin caller ID.

Vishing calls can display a caller ID or phone number from any source the attacker thinks might cause the victim to answer the call. Some attackers just duplicate your area code and prefix in order to trick the victim into thinking the call is from a neighbor or other local entity. Vishing is simply another form of phishing attack. Vishing involves the pretexting of the displayed caller ID and the story the attacker spouts. Always assume caller ID is false or at least incorrect.

### Spam

Spam is any type of email that is undesired and/or unsolicited. But spam is not just unwanted advertisements; it can also include malicious content and attack vectors as well. Spam is often used as the carrier of social engineering attacks.

Spam is a problem for numerous reasons:

- Some spam carries malicious code such as viruses, logic bombs, ransomware, or Trojan horses.

- Some spam carries social engineering attacks (also known as hoax messages).

- Unwanted email wastes your time while you sort through it looking for legitimate messages.

- Spam wastes internet resources: storage capacity, computing cycles, and throughput.

The primary countermeasure against spam is an email spam filter. These email filters can examine the header, subject, and contents of a message to look for keywords or phrases that identify it as a known type of spam, and then take the appropriate actions to discard, quarantine, or block the message.

Antispam software is a variation on the theme of antimalware software. It specifically monitors email communications for spam and other forms of unwanted email in order to stop hoaxes, identity theft, waste of resources, and possible distribution of malicious software. Antispam software can often be installed on email servers to protect an entire organization as well as on local client systems for supplemental filtering by the user.

In addition to client application or client-side spam filters, there are enterprise spam tools, including Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) (see Chapter 12 , “Secure Communications and Network Attacks”).

Another important issue to address when managing spam is spoofed email. A spoofed email is a message that has a fake or falsified source address. DMARC is used to filter spoofed messages.

Spam is most commonly associated with email, but spam also exists in instant messaging (IM), SMS, USENET (Network News Transfer Protocol [NNTP]), and web content (such as threaded discussions, forums, comments, and blogs). Failing to block spam allows it to waste resources, consume bandwidth, distract workers from productive activities, and potentially expose users and systems to malware.

### Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder surfing is often a physical world or in-person form of social engineering. Shoulder surfing occurs when someone is able to watch a user's keyboard or view their display. Often, shoulder surfing is stopped by dividing worker groups by sensitivity levels and limiting access to certain areas of the building by using locked doors. Additionally, users should not orient their displays to be visible through windows (from outside) or walkways/doorways (for internal issues). And they should not work on sensitive data while in a public space. Password fields should mask characters as they are typed. Another defense against shoulder surfing is the use of screen filters, which limit the field of view to mostly a perpendicular orientation.

### Invoice Scams

Invoice scams are social engineering attacks that often attempt to steal funds from an organization or individuals through the presentation of a false invoice, often followed by strong inducements to pay. Attackers often try to target members of financial departments or accounting groups. Some invoice scams are actually spear phishing scams in disguise. It is also possible for a social engineer to use an invoice scam approach over a voice connection.

This attack is similar to some forms of the BEC concept. In fact, some invoice scams are combined with BEC so that the invoice sent to an accounting worker is seemingly sent from the CEO. This intertwining of attack elements adds more legitimacy to the invoice, thus potentially convincing the target to pay the invoice.

To protect against invoice scams, workers must be informed of the proper channels through which they should receive invoices and the means by which to confirm that any invoices are actually valid. Separation of duties should exist between workers that place orders for products and services and those who pay invoices. These two groups should also have a third group that audits and governs their activities. All potential acquisitions should be reviewed and approved by a supervisor, and then notice of the acquisition should be sent to the accounts payable department by that supervisor. When invoices arrive, they should be compared against the expected bills based on approved acquisitions. Any invoice that is not expected or otherwise abnormal should trigger a face-to-face discussion with the supervisor or other financial executive.

Discovery of any fraudulent invoices should be reported to the authorities. Digital transmission and postal delivery of invoice scams are considered a crime of fraud and potential theft. The sending of false invoices through the U.S. Postal Service may be considered postal fraud as well.

### Hoax

A hoax is a form of social engineering designed to convince targets to perform an action that will cause problems or reduce their IT security. A hoax can be an email that proclaims some imminent threat is spreading across the internet and that you must perform certain tasks in order to protect yourself. The hoax often claims that taking no action will result in harm. Victims may be instructed to delete files, change configuration settings, or install fraudulent security software, which results in a compromised OS, a non-booting OS, or a reduction in their security defenses. Additionally, hoax emails often encourage the victim to forward the message to all their contacts in order to “spread the word.” Hoax messages are often spoofed without a verifiable origin.

Whenever you encounter a potential hoax or just are concerned that a claimed threat is real, do the research. A couple of great places to check for hoax information or to look up your suspected hoax message are snopes.com and phishtank.com .

### Impersonation and Masquerading

Impersonation is the act of taking on the identity of someone else. This can take place in person, over the phone, through email, by logging into someone's account, or through any other means of communication. Impersonation can also be known as masquerading , spoofing, and even identity fraud. In some circumstances, impersonation is defined as a more sophisticated and complex attack, whereas masquerading is amateurish and simpler. This distinction is emphasized in the difference between renting an Elvis costume (i.e., masquerading) for a party versus being a career Elvis impersonator.

Defenses against physical location impersonation can include the use of access badges and security guards, and requiring the presentation and verification of ID at all entrances. If nontypical personnel are to visit a facility, the visit should be prearranged and the security guards provided with reasonable and confirmed notice that a nonemployee will be visiting. The organization from which the visitor hails should provide identification details, including a photo ID. When the person arrives, their identity should be compared against the provided credentials. In most secure environments, visitors are not allowed to roam free. Instead, an escort must accompany the visitor for their entire time within the company's security perimeter.

### Tailgating and Piggybacking

Tailgating occurs when an unauthorized entity gains access to a facility under the authorization of a valid worker but without their knowledge. This attack can occur when a worker uses their valid credentials to unlock and open a door, then walks into the building as the door closes, granting the attacker the opportunity to stop the door from closing and to sneak in without the victim realizing. Tailgating is an attack that does not depend on the consent of the victim—just their obliviousness to what occurs behind them as they walk into a building.

Each and every time a user unlocks or opens a door, they should ensure that it is closed and locked before walking away. This action alone eliminates tailgating, but it does require that workers change their behavior. There is also social pressure to hold open a door for someone who is walking up behind you, but this courtesy should not be extended to include secure entry points, even if you think you know the person walking up behind.

Company policy should be focused on changing user behavior toward more security, but realize that working against human nature is very hard. Therefore, other means of enforcing tailgating protections should be implemented. These can include the use of access control vestibules (previously known as mantraps), security cameras, and security guards. Security cameras act as a deterrent more than a prevention, but having a recording of tailgating events can help track down the perpetrators as well as pinpoint the workers who need more security training. A security guard can watch over an entrance to ensure that only valid personnel are let through a security checkpoint.

A problem similar to tailgating is piggybacking. Piggybacking occurs when an unauthorized entity gains access to a facility under the authorization of a valid worker by tricking the victim into providing consent. This could happen when the intruder feigns the need for assistance by holding a large box or lots of paperwork and asks someone to “hold the door.” The goal of the intruder is to distract the victim while the attacker gains access in order to prevent the victim from realizing that the attacker did not provide their own credentials. This ploy depends on the good nature of most people to believe the pretext, especially when they seem to have “dressed the part.”

When someone asks for assistance in holding open a secured door, users should ask for proof of authorization or offer to swipe the person's access card on their behalf. Or, the worker should redirect the person to the main entrance controlled by security guards or call over a security guard to handle the situation. Also, the use of access control vestibules, turnstiles, and security cameras are useful in response to piggybacking. These controls reduce the chance of an outsider bluffing their way into your secured areas.

# Baiting

When direct physical entry isn't possible or attempts fail, adversaries may use a baiting technique to deposit malware onto internal systems. Baiting is when the attacker drops USB sticks, optical discs, or even wallets in a location that a worker is likely to encounter it. The hope is the worker will plug the USB drive or insert the disc into a work computer where the malware will auto-infect the system. The wallet often has a note in it with a URL or IP address along with credentials. The hope is the victim will visit the site from a work computer and be infected by a drive-by-download event or be tricked by a phishing site.

### Dumpster Diving

Dumpster diving is the act of digging through trash, discarded equipment, or abandoned locations in order to obtain information about a target organization or individual. Typical collected items include old calendars, calling lists, handwritten meeting notes, discarded forms, product boxes, user manuals, sticky notes, printed reports, or the test sheet from a printer. Just about anything that is of any minor internal value or sensitivity is a treasure to be discovered through dumpster diving. The materials gathered via dumpster diving can be used to craft a more believable pretext.

To prevent dumpster diving, or at least reduce its value to an attacker, all documents should be shredded and/or incinerated before being discarded. Additionally, no storage media should ever be discarded in the trash; use a secure disposal technique or service. Secure storage media disposal often includes incineration, shredding, or chipping.

### Identity Fraud

Identity fraud and identity theft are terms that are often used interchangeably. In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) states that “Identity theft and identity fraud are terms used to refer to all types of crime in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data in some way that involves fraud or deception, typically for economic gain” ( www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/identity-theft/identity-theft-and-identity-fraud ). Identity fraud and identity theft can be both the purpose of a social engineering attack (i.e., to steal PII) as well as a tool used to further the success of a social engineering attack.

However, it is important to recognize that while we can use the terms as synonyms (especially in casual conversation), there is more value to be gained by understanding how they are different.

Identity theft is the act of stealing someone's identity. Specifically, this can refer to the initial act of information gathering or elicitation where usernames, emails, passwords, answers to secret questions, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, healthcare services numbers, and other related and relevant facts are stolen or otherwise obtained by the attacker. So, the first definition of identity theft is the actual theft of the credentials and information for someone's accounts or financial positions.

A second definition of identity theft is when those stolen credentials and details are used to take over someone's account. This could include logging into their account on an online service; making false charges to their credit card, ATM card, or debit card; writing false checks against their checking account; or opening a new line of credit in the victim's name using their Social Security number. When an attacker steals and uses a victim's credentials, this is known as credential hijacking .

This second definition of identity theft is also very similar to the definition of identity fraud. Fraud is when you claim something that is false to be true. Identity fraud is when you falsely claim to be someone else through the use of stolen information from the victim. Identity fraud is criminal impersonation or intentional deception for personal or financial gain. Examples of identity fraud include taking employment under someone else's Social Security number, initiating phone service or utilities in someone else's name, or using someone else's health insurance to gain medical services.

You can consider identity theft and identity fraud to be a form of spoofing. Spoofing is any action to hide a valid identity, often by taking on the identity of something else. In addition to the concept of human-focused spoofing (i.e., identity fraud), spoofing is a common tactic for hackers against technology. Hackers often spoof email addresses, IP addresses, media access control (MAC) addresses, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) communications, Wi-Fi networks, websites, mobile phone apps, and more. These and other spoofing-related topics are covered elsewhere in this book.

Identity theft and identity fraud are also related to impersonation. Impersonation is the act of taking on someone's identity. This might be accomplished by logging into their account with stolen credentials or claiming to be someone else when on the phone. These and other impersonation concepts were covered earlier in the “Impersonation and Masquerading” section.

As a current or future victim of identity theft/fraud, you should take actions to reduce your vulnerability, increase the chance of detecting such attacks, and improve your defenses against this type of injustice. For information on these defenses, see www.usa.gov/identity-theft and www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0235-identity-theft-protection-services .

### Typo Squatting

Typo squatting is a practice employed to capture and redirect traffic when a user mistypes the domain name or IP address of an intended resource. This is a social engineering attack that takes advantage of a person's potential to mistype a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or address. A malicious site squatter predicts URL typos and then registers those domain names to direct traffic to their own site. This can be done for competition or for malicious intent. The variations used for typo squatting include common misspellings (such as googel.com ), typing errors (such as gooogle.com ), variations on a name or word (for example, plurality, as in googles.com ), and different top-level domains (TLDs) (such as google.edu ).

URL hijacking can also refer to the practice of displaying a link or advertisement that looks like that of a well-known product, service, or site but, when clicked, redirects the user to an alternate location, service, or product. This may be accomplished by posting sites and pages and exploiting search engine optimization (SEO) to cause your content to occur higher in search results, or through the use of adware that replaces legitimate ads and links with those leading to alternate or malicious locations.

Clickjacking is a means to redirect a user's click or selection on a web page to an alternate, often malicious target instead of the intended and desired location. This can be accomplished through several techniques. Some alter the code of the original web page in order to include script that will automatically replace the valid URL with an alternate URL at the moment the mouse click or selection occurs. Another means is to add an invisible or hidden overlay, frame, or image map over the displayed page.

### Influence Campaigns

Influence campaigns are social engineering attacks that attempt to guide, adjust, or change public opinion. Although such attacks might be undertaken by hackers against individuals or organizations, most influence campaigns seem to be waged by nation-states against their real or perceived foreign enemies.

Influence campaigns are linked to the distribution of disinformation, propaganda, false information, “fake news,” and even the activity of doxing. Misleading, incomplete, crafted, and altered information can be used as part of an influence campaign to adjust the perception of readers and viewers to the concepts, thoughts, and ideologies of the influencer. These tactics have been used by invaders for centuries to turn a population against their own government. In the current digital information age, influence campaigns are easier to wage than ever before and some of the perpetrators are domestic. Modern influence campaigns don't need to rely on distribution of printed materials but can digitally transmit the propaganda directly to the targets.

Doxing is the collection of information about an individual or an organization (which can also include governments and the military) in order to disclose the collected data publicly for the purpose of chaining the perception of the target. Doxing can include withholding of information that contradicts the intended narrative of the attacker. Doxing can fabricate or alter information to place false accusations against the target. Doxing has been an unfortunately effective tool against individuals and organizations deployed by hackers, hacktivists, journalists, and governments alike.

#### Hybrid Warfare

Nations no longer limit their attacks against their real or perceived enemies using traditional, kinetic weaponry. Now they combine classical military strategy with modern capabilities, including social engineering, digital influence campaigns, psychological warfare efforts, political tactics, and cyberwarfare capabilities. This is known as hybrid warfare . Some entities use the term nonlinear warfare to refer to this concept.

It is important to realize that nations will use whatever tools or weapons are available to them when they feel threatened or decide they must strike first. With the use of hybrid warfare tactics, there is far greater risk to every individual than in battles of the past. Now with cyberwar and influence campaigns, every person can be targeted and potentially harmed. Keep in mind that harm is not just physical in hybrid warfare; it can also damage reputation, finances, digital infrastructure, and relationships.

#### Social Media

Social media has become a weapon in the hands of nation-states as they wage elements of hybrid warfare against their targets. In the last decade, we have seen evidence of several nations, including our own, participate in social media–based influence campaigns. You should realize that you cannot just assume that content you see on a social network is accurate, valid, or complete. Even when quoted by your friends, when referenced in popular media, when seemingly in line with your own expectations, you have to be skeptical of everything that reaches you through your digital communication devices. The use and abuse of social media by adversaries foreign and domestic brings the social engineering attack concept to a whole new level.

A great resource for learning how not to fall for false information distributed through the internet is the “Navigating Digital Information” series presented by the YouTube channel CrashCourse: www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU .

Workers can easily waste time and system resources by interacting with social media when that task is not part of their job description. The company's acceptable user policy (AUP) should indicate that workers need to focus on work while at work rather than spending time on personal or non-work-related tasks.

Social media can be a means by which workers intentionally or accidentally distribute internal, confidential, proprietary, or PII data to outsiders. This may be accomplished by typing in messages or participating in chats in which they reveal confidential information. This can also be accomplished by distributing or publishing sensitive documents. Responses to social media issues can include blocking access to social media sites by adding IP blocks to firewalls and resolution filters to Domain Name System (DNS) queries. Violating workers need to be reprimanded or even terminated.
