## Exam Essentials

Know the common types of natural disasters that may threaten an organization. Natural disasters that commonly threaten organizations include earthquakes, floods, storms, fires, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.

Know the common types of human-made disasters that may threaten an organization. Explosions, electrical fires, terrorist acts, power outages, other utility failures, infrastructure failures, hardware/software failures, labor difficulties, theft, and vandalism are all common human-made disasters.

Be familiar with the common types of recovery facilities. The common types of recovery facilities are cold sites, warm sites, hot sites, mobile sites, and multiple sites. Be sure you understand the benefits and drawbacks of each such facility.

Explain the potential benefits behind mutual assistance agreements as well as the reasons they are not commonly implemented in businesses today. Mutual assistance agreements (MAAs) provide an inexpensive alternative to disaster recovery sites, but they are not commonly used because they are difficult to enforce. Organizations participating in an MAA may also be shut down by the same disaster, and MAAs raise confidentiality concerns.

Understand the technologies that may assist with database backup. Databases benefit from three backup technologies. Electronic vaulting is used to transfer database backups to a remote site as part of a bulk transfer. In remote journaling, data transfers occur on a more frequent basis. With remote mirroring technology, database transactions are mirrored at the backup site in real time.

Explain the common processes used in disaster recovery programs. These programs should take a comprehensive approach to planning and include considerations related to the initial response effort, personnel involved, communication among the team members and with internal and external entities, assessment of response efforts, and restoration of services. DR programs should also include training and awareness efforts to ensure personnel understand their responsibilities and lessons learned sessions to continuously improve the program.

Know the five types of disaster recovery plan tests and the impact each has on normal business operations. The five types of disaster recovery plan tests are read-through tests, structured walk-throughs, simulation tests, parallel tests, and full-interruption tests. Checklist tests are purely paperwork exercises, whereas structured walk-throughs involve a project team meeting. Neither has an impact on business operations. Simulation tests may shut down noncritical business units. Parallel tests involve relocating personnel but do not affect day-to-day operations. Full-interruption tests involve shutting down primary systems and shifting responsibility to the recovery facility.
