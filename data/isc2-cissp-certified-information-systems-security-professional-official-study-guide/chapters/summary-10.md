## Summary

In all circumstances and under all conditions, the most important goal of security is protecting people.

Several elements are involved in implementing and maintaining physical security. One core element is selecting or designing the facility to house your IT infrastructure and the operations of your organization. You must start with a plan that outlines the security needs for your organization and develops through a process known as critical path analysis. Additional elements of a secure facility plan are to evaluate site selection and visibility requirements and consider facility design elements such as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).

The security controls implemented to manage physical security can be divided into three groups: administrative (management, managerial, or procedural), technical (logical), and physical. Administrative physical security controls include facility construction and selection, site management, building design, personnel controls, awareness training, and emergency response and procedures. Technical physical security controls include building access controls; intrusion detection; alarms; security cameras; monitoring; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) power supplies; and fire detection and suppression. Physical controls for physical security include fencing, lighting, locks, construction materials, access control vestibules (formerly known as mantraps), guard dogs, and security guards.

Wiring closets and server rooms are important infrastructure elements that require protection. They often house core networking devices and other sensitive equipment. Protections include adequate locks, smartcards for authentication, proximity devices and readers intrusion detection systems, cameras, surveillance, access control, and regular physical inspections.

An important aspect of physical access control and maintaining the security of a facility is protecting the basic elements of the environment; this may include the use of media storage facilities, evidence storage, and work area restrictions. Providing clean power sources, minimizing interference, and managing the environment are also important.

Fire detection and suppression must not be overlooked. In addition to protecting people, fire detection and suppression are designed to keep damage caused by fire, smoke, heat, and suppression materials to a minimum, especially in regard to the IT infrastructure.

Additional physical security mechanisms to implement and manage include perimeter breach detection, fences, gates, turnstiles, access control vestibules, lighting, security guards, guard dogs, locks, badges, protected cable distribution, motion detectors, intrusion alarms, and secondary verification mechanisms. It is also essential to evaluate regulatory compliance and track KPIs.
