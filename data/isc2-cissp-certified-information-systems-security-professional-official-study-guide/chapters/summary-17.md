## Summary

The CISSP Security Operations domain lists several specific incident management steps. Detection is the first step and can come from automated tools or employee observations. Personnel investigate alerts to determine if an actual incident has occurred and if so, the next step is a response. Containment of the incident is essential during the mitigation stage. It's also important to protect any evidence during all stages of incident management. Reporting may be required based on governing laws or an organization's security policy. In the recovery stage, the system is restored to full operation, and it's important to ensure that it is restored to at least as secure a state as it was before the attack. The remediation stage includes a root cause analysis and will often include recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence. Last, the lessons learned stage examines the incident and the response to determine if there are any lessons to be learned.

Preventive and detective measures help prevent security incidents and detect them if they occur. This includes basic preventive measures such as keeping systems and applications up to date with current patches, removing or disabling unneeded services and protocols, using intrusion detection and prevention systems, using antimalware software with up-to-date signatures, and enabling both host-based and network-based firewalls. It also includes using advanced tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, honeypots, and honeynets.

Logging and monitoring provide overall accountability when combined with effective identification and authentication practices. Logging involves recording events in logs and database files. Security logs, system logs, application logs, firewall logs, proxy logs, and change management logs are all common log files. Log files include valuable data and should be protected to ensure that they aren't modified, deleted, or corrupted. If they are not protected, attackers will often try to modify or delete them, and they will not be admissible as evidence to prosecute an attacker.

Automating incident response techniques helps reduce the workload of administrators. These include the use of SOAR technologies, along with machine learning and automated intelligence tools. Using threat intelligence helps find threats within a network before traditional security tools locate them.
