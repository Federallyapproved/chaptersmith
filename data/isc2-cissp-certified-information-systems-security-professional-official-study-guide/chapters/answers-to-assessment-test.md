## Answers to Assessment Test

- C. Detective access controls are used to discover (and document) unwanted or unauthorized activity. Preventive access controls block the ability to perform unwanted activity. Deterrent access controls attempt to persuade the perpetrator not to perform unwanted activity. Corrective access controls restore a system to normal function in the event of a failure or system interruption.

- D. Strong password choices are difficult to guess, unpredictable, and of specified minimum lengths to ensure that password entries cannot be computationally determined. They may be randomly generated and use all the alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation characters; they should never be written down or shared; they should not be stored in publicly accessible or generally readable locations; and they shouldn't be transmitted in the clear.

- B. Network-based IDSs are usually able to detect the initiation of an attack or the ongoing attempts to perpetrate an attack (including denial of service, or DoS). They are, however, unable to provide information about whether an attack was successful or which specific systems, user accounts, files, or applications were affected. Host-based IDSs have some difficulty with detecting and tracking down DoS attacks. Vulnerability scanners don't detect DoS attacks; they test for possible vulnerabilities. Penetration testing may cause a DoS or test for DoS vulnerabilities, but it is not a detection tool.

- B. Not all instances of DoS are the result of a malicious attack. Errors in coding OSs, services, and applications have resulted in DoS conditions. Some examples of this include a process failing to release control of the CPU or a service consuming system resources out of proportion to the service requests it is handling. Social engineering (i.e., pretending to be a technical manager) and sniffing (i.e., intercepting network traffic) are typically not considered DoS attacks. Sending message packets to a recipient who did not request them simply to be annoying may be a type of social engineering and it is definitely spam, but unless the volume of the messages is significant, it does not warrant the label of DoS.

- A. Network hardware devices, including routers, function at layer 3, the Network layer. Layer 1, the Physical layer, is where repeaters and hubs operate, not routers. The Transport layer, layer 4, is where circuit level firewalls and proxies operate, not routers. Layer 5, the Session layer, does not actually exist in a modern TCP/IP network, and thus no hardware directly operates at this layer, but its functions are performed by TCP in the Transport layer, layer 4, when sessions are in use.

- D. Stateful inspection firewalls (aka dynamic packet-filtering firewall) enable the real-time modification of the filtering rules based on traffic content and context. The other firewalls listed as options—static packet filtering, application level, and circuit level—are all stateless and thus do not consider the context when applying filtering rules.

- D. A virtual private network (VPN) link can be established over any network communication connection. This could be a typical LAN cable connection, a wireless LAN connection, a remote access dial-up connection, a WAN link, or even an internet connection used by a client for access to the office LAN.

- C. A Trojan horse is a form of malware that uses social engineering tactics to trick a victim into installing it—the trick is to make the victim believe that the only thing they have downloaded or obtained is the host file, when in fact it has a malicious hidden payload. Viruses and logic bombs do not typically use social engineering as an element in their means of infecting a system. A worm sometimes is designed to take advantage of social engineering, such as when the worm is an executable email attachment and the message tricks the victim into opening it. However, not all worms are designed this way—this is a core design concept of a Trojan horse.

- D. The components of the CIA Triad are confidentiality, availability, and integrity. The other options are not the terms that define the CIA Triad, although they are security concepts that need to be evaluated when establishing a security infrastructure.

- B. Privacy is not necessary to provide accountability. The required elements of accountability, as defined in AAA services, are as follows: identification (which is sometimes considered an element of authentication, a silent first step of AAA services, or represented by IAAA), authentication (i.e., identification verification), authorization (i.e., access control), auditing (i.e., logging and monitoring), and accounting.

- C. Group user accounts allow for multiple people to log in under a single user account. This allows collusion because it prevents individual accountability. Separation of duties, restricted job responsibilities, and job rotation help establish individual accountability and control access (especially to privileged capabilities), which in turn limits or restricts collusion.

- B. The data owner must first assign a security label to a resource before the data custodian can secure the resource appropriately. Senior management is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of a security endeavor. An auditor is responsible for reviewing and verifying that the security policy is properly implemented, that the derived security solutions are adequate, and that user events are in compliance with security policy. The security staff is responsible for designing, implementing, and managing the security infrastructure once approved by senior management.

- C. The Managed phase (level 4) of the SW-CMM involves the use of quantitative development metrics. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) defines the key process areas for this level as Quantitative Process Management and Software Quality Management. The Repeatable phase (level 2) is where basic lifecycle processes are introduced. The Defined phase (level 3) is where developers operate according to a set of formal, documented development processes. The Optimizing phase (level 5) is where a process of continuous improvement is achieved.

- B. Layers 1 and 2 contain device drivers but are not normally implemented in practice, since they are often collapsed into layer 0. Layer 0 always contains the security kernel. Layer 3 contains user applications. Layer 4 does not exist in the design concept, but it may exist in customized implementations.

- B. The SYN flagged packet is first sent from the initiating host to the destination host. The destination host then responds with a SYN/ACK flagged packet. The initiating host sends an ACK flagged packet, and the connection is then established. The FIN flagged packet is not used in the TCP three-way handshake to establish a session; it is used in the session teardown process.

- B. Parameter checking (i.e., confirming input is within reasonable boundaries) is used to prevent the possibility of buffer overflow attacks. Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTTOU) attacks are not directly addressed by parameter checking or input filtering; defensive coding practices are needed to eliminate or reduce this issue. SYN flood attacks are a type of DoS, which is not fully protected against with just improved coding practices. A DDoS is also not prohibited by just improved coding practices such as parameter checking. For any type of DoS, adequate filtering and processing capacity are the most effective security responses.

- A. The ⊕ symbol represents the XOR function and returns a true value when only one of the input values is true. If both values are false or both values are true, the output of the XOR function is false. Option B is the result if these two values were combined using the AND (the ∧ symbol) function, which returns a value of true if the two values are both true. Option C is the result if these two values were combined using the OR (the ∨ symbol) function, which returns a value of true if either input values is true. Option D is the result if only the X value was subjected to the NOR (the ~ symbol) function, which reverses the value of an input.

- A, C, E, F, I, J. There are six standard data type classifications used in either a government/military or a private sector organization in this list of options: public, private, sensitive, proprietary, critical, and confidential. The other options (healthy, internal, essential, certified, and for your eyes only) are incorrect since they are not typical or standard classifications.

- C. The correct statement is regarding the data controller. The other statements are incorrect. The correct versions of those statements are as follows. A data owner is the entity assigned specific responsibility for a data asset in order to ensure its protection for use by the organization. A data processor is the entity that performs operations on data. A data custodian is the entity assigned or delegated the day-to-day responsibility for proper storage and transport as well as protecting data, assets, and other organizational objects.

- C. Any recipient can use Mike's public key to verify the authenticity of the digital signature. Renee's (the recipient) public key is not used in this scenario. However, it could be used to create a digital envelope to protect a symmetric session encryption key sent from Mike to Renee. Renee's (the recipient) private key is not used in this scenario. However, it could be used if Renee becomes a sender to send Mike a digitally signed message. Mike's (the sender) private key was used to encrypt the hash of the data to be sent to Renee, and this is what creates the digital signature.

- D. In this scenario, the data is encrypted at rest with AES-256. There is no mention of encryption for transfer or processing. The data is not stored redundantly, since it is being moved, not copied, to the central data warehouse, and there is no mention of a backup.

- A. The data owner is the person(s) (or entity) assigned specific responsibility for a data asset in order to ensure its protection for use by the organization. The data controller is the entity that makes decisions about the data they are collecting. A data processor is the entity that performs operations on data on behalf of a data controller. A data custodian or steward is a subject who has been assigned or delegated the day-to-day responsibility for proper storage and transport as well as protecting data, assets, and other organizational objects.

- B, D. In this scenario, the data loss prevention (DLP) alerts and log analysis are the only options that would potentially include useful information in regard to an insider exfiltrating the sensitive documents. The other options are incorrect because they do not provide relevant information. Network access control (NAC) is a security mechanism to prevent rogue devices and ensure authorized systems meet minimum security configuration requirements. Syslog is a logging service used to maintain centralized real-time copies of active log files. Malware scanner reports are not relevant here since there is no suspicious or malicious code being used but only access abuses and unauthorized file distribution. Integrity monitoring is also not relevant to this situation, since there is no indication that the documents were altered, just that they were released to the public.

- C. WPA3 supports ENT (Enterprise Wi-Fi authentication, aka IEEE 802.1X) and SAE authentication. Simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) still uses a password, but it no longer encrypts and sends that password across the connection to perform authentication. Instead, SAE performs a zero-knowledge proof process known as Dragonfly Key Exchange, which is itself a derivative of Diffie–Hellman. IEEE 802.1X defines port-based network access control that ensures that clients can't communicate with a resource until proper authentication has taken place. It's based on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) from Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). However, this is the technology behind the label of ENT; thus, it is not an option in this scenario. IEEE 802.1q defines the use of virtual local area network (VLAN) tags and thus is not relevant to Wi-Fi authentication. Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) is a Cisco protocol proposed to replace Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP), which is now obsolete, thanks to the development of WPA2, and is not supported in WPA3 either.

- A, C, E, H. Biometrics are authentication factors that are based on a user's physical attributes; they include fingerprints, voice, retina, and facial recognition. Gait is a form of biometrics, but it is not appropriate for use as authentication on a mobile device; it is used from a stationary position to monitor people walking toward or past a security point. The other options are valid authentication factors, but they are not biometrics.

- B. A repair technician typically requires more than a normal level of access to perform their duties, so a privileged account for even a trusted third-party technician is appropriate. A guest account or user (normal, limited) account is insufficient for this scenario. A service account is to be used by an application or background service, not a repair technician or other user.

- C. Penetration testing is the attempt to bypass security controls to test overall system security. Logging usage data is a type of auditing and is useful in the authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA) service process in order to hold subjects accountable for their actions. However, it is not a means to test security. War dialing is an attempt to locate modems and fax machines by dialing phone numbers. This process is sometimes still used by penetration testers and adversaries to find targets to attack, but it is not an actual attack or stress test itself. Deploying secured desktop workstations is a security response to the results of a penetration test, not a security testing method.

- A. Auditing is a required factor to sustain and enforce accountability. Auditing is one of the elements of the AAA services concept of identification, authentication, authorizations, auditing, and accounting (or accountability). Confidentiality is a core security element of the CIA Triad, but it is not dependent on auditing. Accessibility is the assurance that locations and systems are able to be used by the widest range of people/users possible. Redundancy is the implementation of alternatives, backup options, and recovery measures and methods to avoid single points of failure to ensure that downtime is minimized while maintaining availability.

- A. The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is computed as the product of the asset value (AV) times the exposure factor (EF) times the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). This is the longer form of the formula ALE = SLE * ARO, since SLE = AV * EF. The other formulas displayed here do not accurately reflect this calculation, since they are not valid or typical risk formulas.

- A. Identification of priorities is the first step of the business impact assessment process. Likelihood assessment is the third step or phase of BIA. Risk identification is the second step of BIA. Resource prioritization is the last step of BIA.

- D. Natural events that can threaten organizations include earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other acts of nature. Thus options A, B, and C are correct because they are natural and not human caused.

- A. Hot sites provide backup facilities maintained in constant working order and fully capable of taking over business operations. Warm sites consist of preconfigured hardware and software to run the business, neither of which possesses the vital business information. Cold sites are simply facilities designed with power and environmental support systems but no configured hardware, software, or services. Disaster recovery services can facilitate and implement any of these sites on behalf of a company.

- D. The issue revealed by the audit report is that one account has a password that is older than the requirements allow for; thus, correcting the password maximum age security setting should resolve this. There is no information in regard to password length, lockout, or password reuse in the audit report, so these options are not of concern in this situation.

- C. Written documents brought into court to prove the facts of a case are referred to as documentary evidence. Best evidence is a form of documentary evidence, but specifically it is the original document rather than a copy or description. Parol evidence is based on a rule stating that when an agreement between parties is put into written form, the written document is assumed to contain all the terms of the agreement and no verbal agreements may modify the written agreement. Testimonial evidence consists of the testimony of a witness's experience, either verbal testimony in court or written testimony in a recorded deposition.

- A, B. If your organization depends on custom-developed software or software products produced through outsourced code development, then the risks of that arrangement need to be evaluated and mitigated. First, the quality and security of the code needs to be assessed. Second, if the third-party development group goes out of business, can you continue to operate with the code as is? You may need to abandon the existing code to switch to a new development group. It is not true that third-party code development is always more expensive; it is often less expensive. A software escrow agreement (SEA) is not an issue that John would want to bring up as a reason to keep development in house, since a SEA is a means to reduce the risk of a third-party developer group ceasing to exist.

- D. HTTPS:// is the correct prefix for the use of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) over TLS (Transport Layer Security). This was the same prefix when SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) was used to encrypt HTTP, but SSL has been deprecated. SHTTP:// is for Secure HTTP, which was SSH but SHTTP is also deprecated. TLS:// is an invalid prefix. FTPS:// is a valid prefix that can be used in some web browsers, and it uses TLS to encrypt the connection, but it is for securing FTP file exchange rather than web communications.

`HTTPS://`

`SHTTP://`

`TLS://`

`FTPS://`

- C. The CSO in this scenario is demonstrating the need to follow the security principle of change management. Change management usually involves extensive planning, testing, logging, auditing, and monitoring of activities related to security controls and mechanisms. This scenario is not describing a BCP event. A BCP event would involve the evaluation of threats to business processes and then the creation of response scenarios to address those issues. This scenario is not describing onboarding. Onboarding is the process of integrating a new element (such as an employee or device) into an existing system of security infrastructure. Although loosely similar to change management, onboarding focuses more on ensuring compliance with existing security policies by the new member, rather than testing updates for an existing member. Static analysis is used to evaluate source code as a part of a secure development environment. Static analysis may be used as an evaluation tool in change management, but it is a tool, not the principle of security referenced in this scenario.

- D. The two main types of token devices are TOTP and HOTP. Time-based one-time password (TOTP) tokens or synchronous dynamic password tokens are devices or applications that generate passwords at fixed time intervals, such as every 60 seconds. Thus, TOTP produces new time-derived passwords on a specific time interval that can be used only a single time when attempting to authenticate. HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP) tokens or asynchronous dynamic password tokens are devices or applications that generate passwords not based on fixed time intervals but instead based on a nonrepeating one-way function, such as a hash or hash message authentication code (HMAC—a type of hash that uses a symmetric key in the hashing process) operation. HMAC is a hashing function, not a means to authenticate. Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) is used to create authentication federation (i.e. sharing) links; it is not itself a means to authenticate.

- A.. The most important security concern from this list of options in relation to a CSP is the data retention policy. The data retention policy defines what information or data is being collected by the CSP, how long it will be kept, how it is destroyed, why it is kept, and who can access it. The number of customers and what hardware is used are not significant security concerns in comparison to data retention. Whether the CSP offers MaaS, IDaaS, and SaaS is not as important as data retention, especially if these are not services your organization needs or wants. One of the keys to answering this question is to consider the range of CSP options, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and the type of organizations that are technically CSP SaaS but that we don't often think of as such (examples include Facebook, Google, and Amazon). These organizations absolutely have access to customer/user data, and thus, their data retention policies are of utmost concern (at least compared to the other options provided).

- AB, C, D. Programmers need to adopt secure coding practices, which include using stored procedures, code signing, and server-side validation. A stored procedure is a subroutine or software module that can be called on or accessed by applications interacting with a relational database management system (RDBMS). Code signing is the activity of crafting a digital signature of a software program in order to confirm that it was not changed and who it is from. Server-side data validation is suited for protecting a system against input submitted by a malicious user. Using immutable systems is not a secure coding technique; instead, an immutable system is a server or software product that, once configured and deployed, is never altered in place. File size optimization may be efficient but is not necessarily a secure coding technique. Using third-party software libraries may reduce workload to minimize the amount of new code to author, but third-party software libraries are a risk because they can introduce vulnerabilities, especially when closed source libraries are used. Thus, use of third-party software libraries is not a secure coding technique unless the security posture of the externally sourced code is verified, which was not mentioned as an answer option.
