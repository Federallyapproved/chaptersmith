## Summary

Asset security focuses on collecting, handling, and protecting information throughout its lifecycle. This includes sensitive information stored or processed on computing systems or transferred over a network and the assets used in these processes. Sensitive information is any information that an organization keeps private and can include multiple levels of classifications. Proper destruction methods ensure that data can't be retrieved after destruction.

Data protection methods include digital rights management (DRM) and using cloud access security brokers (CASBs) when using cloud resources. DRM methods attempt to protect copyrighted materials. A CASB is software placed logically between users and cloud-based resources. It can ensure that cloud resources have the same protections as resources within a network. Entities that must comply with the EU GDPR use additional data protection methods such as pseudonymization, tokenization, and anonymization.

Personnel can fulfill many different roles when handling data. Data owners are ultimately responsible for classifying, labeling, and protecting data. System owners are responsible for the systems that process the data. The GDPR defines data controllers, data processors, and data custodians. Data controllers decide what data to process and how to process it. A data controller can hire a third party to process data, and in this context, the third party is the data processor. Data processors have a responsibility to protect the privacy of the data and not use it for any purpose other than directed by the data controller. A custodian is delegated day-to-day responsibilities for properly storing and protecting data.

Security baselines provide a set of security controls that an organization can implement as a secure starting point. Some publications (such as NIST SP 800-53B) identify security control baselines. However, these baselines don't apply equally to all organizations. Instead, organizations use scoping and tailoring techniques to identify the security controls to implement after selecting baselines. Additionally, organizations ensure that they implement security controls mandated by external standards that apply to their organization.
