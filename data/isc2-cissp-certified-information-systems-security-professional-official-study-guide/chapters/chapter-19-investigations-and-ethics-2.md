## Chapter 19: Investigations and Ethics

- The major categories of computer crime are military/intelligence attacks, business attacks, financial attacks, terrorist attacks, grudge attacks, and thrill attacks.

- Thrill attacks are motivated by individuals seeking to achieve the “high” associated with successfully breaking into a computer system.

- Interviews are conducted with the intention of gathering information from individuals to assist with your investigation. Interrogations are conducted with the intent of gathering evidence from suspects to be used in a criminal prosecution.

- To be admissible, evidence must be reliable, competent, and material to the case.
