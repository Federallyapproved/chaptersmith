## Review Questions

- Among the many aspects of a security solution, the most important is whether it addresses a specific need (i.e., a threat) for your assets. But there are many other aspects of security you should consider as well. A significant benefit of a security control is when it goes unnoticed by users. What is this called?

- A phreaker has been apprehended who had been exploiting the technology deployed in your office building. Several handcrafted tools and electronics were taken in as evidence that the phreaker had in their possession when they were arrested. What was this adversary likely focusing on with their attempts to compromise the organization? Accounting NAT PBX Wi-Fi

- Accounting

- Multimedia collaboration is the use of various multimedia-supporting communication solutions to enhance distance collaboration (people working on a project together remotely). Often, collaboration allows workers to work simultaneously as well as across different time frames. Which of the following are important security mechanisms to impose on multimedia collaboration tools? (Choose all that apply.) Encryption of communications Multifactor authentication Customization of avatars and filters Logging of events and activities

- Encryption of communications

- Multifactor authentication

- Michael is configuring a new web server to offer instruction manuals and specification sheets to customers. The web server has been positioned in the screened subnet and assigned an IP address of 172.31.201.17, and the public side of the company's split-DNS has associated the documents.myexamplecompany.com domain name with the assigned IP. After verifying that the website is accessible from his management station (which accesses the screened subnet via a jumpbox) as well as from several worker desktop systems, he declares the project completed and heads home. A few hours later, Michael thinks of a few additional modifications to perform to improve site navigation. However, when he attempts to connect to the new website using the FQDN, he receives a connection error stating that the site cannot be reached. What is the reason for this issue? The jumpbox was not rebooted. Split-DNS does not support internet domain name resolution. The browser is not compatible with the site's coding. A private IP address from RFC 1918 is assigned to the web server.

- The jumpbox was not rebooted.

- Split-DNS does not support internet domain name resolution.

- The browser is not compatible with the site's coding.

- A private IP address from RFC 1918 is assigned to the web server.

- Mark is configuring the remote access server to receive inbound connections from remote workers. He is following a configuration checklist to ensure that the telecommuting links are compliant with company security policy. What authentication protocol offers no encryption or protection for logon credentials? PAP CHAP EAP RADIUS

- PAP

- CHAP

- EAP

- RADIUS

- Some standalone automated data-gathering tools use search engines in their operation. They are able to accomplish this by automatically interacting with the human-interface web portal interface. What enables this capability? Remote control Virtual desktops Remote node operation Screen scraping

- Remote control

- Virtual desktops

- Remote node operation

- Screen scraping

- While evaluating network traffic, you discover several addresses that you are not familiar with. Several of the addresses are in the range of addresses assigned to internal network segments. Which of the following IP addresses are private IPv4 addresses as defined by RFC 1918? (Choose all that apply.) 10.0.0.18 169.254.1:.119 172.31.8.204 192.168.6.43
