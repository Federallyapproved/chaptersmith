## Implement and Manage Physical Security

Many types of physical access control mechanisms can be deployed in an environment to control, monitor, and manage access to a facility. These range from deterrents to detection mechanisms. The various sections, divisions, or areas within a site or facility should be clearly designated as public, private, or restricted. Each of these areas requires unique and focused physical access controls, monitoring, and prevention mechanisms. The following sections discuss many such mechanisms that may be used to separate, isolate, and control access to various areas of a site, including perimeter and internal security.

Signage or signs can be used to declare areas off-limits to those who are not authorized, indicate that security cameras are in use, and disclose safety warnings. Signs are useful in deterring minor criminal activity, establishing a basis for recording events, and guiding people into compliance or adherence with rules or safety precautions. Signs are usually physical displays with words or images, but digital signs and warning banners should be implemented as well on both local and remote connections.

If not mandated by regulations, a self-imposed schedule of control testing should be implemented for door locks, fences, gates, access control vestibules, turnstiles, video cameras, and all other physical security controls.

### Perimeter Security Controls

The accessibility to the building or campus location is also important. Single entrances are great for providing security, but multiple entrances are better for evacuation during emergencies. What types of roads are nearby, such as residential streets or highways? What means of transportation are easily accessible (trains, highway, airport, shipping)? What about traffic levels throughout the day?

Keep in mind that accessibility is also constrained by the need for perimeter security. The needs of access and use should meld and support the implementation and operation of perimeter security. The use of physical access controls and monitoring personnel and equipment entering and leaving, as well as auditing/logging all physical events, are key elements in maintaining overall organizational security.

#### Fences, Gates, Turnstiles, and Access Control Vestibules

A fence is a perimeter-defining device. Fences are used to clearly differentiate between areas that are under a specific level of security protection and those that aren't. Fencing can include a wide range of components, materials, and construction methods. It can consist of stripes painted on the ground, chain link fences, barbed wire, concrete walls, and even invisible perimeters using laser, motion, or heat detectors. Various types of fences are effective against different types of intruders:

- Fences 3 to 4 feet high deter casual trespassers.

- Fences 6 to 7 feet high are too hard to climb easily and deter most intruders, except determined ones.

- Fences 8 or more feet high with strands of barbed or razor wire deter even determined intruders.

An advanced form of fencing is known as a perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system (PIDAS) . A PIDAS is a fence system that has two or three fences used in concert to optimize security. PIDAS fencing is often present around military locations and prisons. Typically, a PIDAS fence has one main tall fence that may be 8 to 20 feet tall. The main fence may be electrified, may have barbed wire/razor wire elements, and/or can include touch detection technologies. This main fence is then surrounded by an outside fence, which may only be 4 to 6 feet tall. The purpose of this outer fence is to keep animals and casual trespassers from accessing the main fence. This reduces the nuisance alarm rate (NAR) or false positives from animals or foliage on interior fences. Additional fences can be located between the main fence and the exterior fence. These additional fences may be electrified or use barbed/razor wire. The space between the fences can serve as a corridor for guard patrols or wandering guard dogs. These corridors are kept free of vegetation.

A gate is a controlled exit and entry point in a fence or wall. The deterrent level of a gate must be equivalent to the deterrent level of the fence to sustain the effectiveness of the fence as a whole. Hinges and locking/closing mechanisms should be hardened against tampering, destruction, or removal. When a gate is closed, it should not offer any additional access vulnerabilities. Keep the number of gates to a minimum. They can be monitored by guards. When they're not protected by guards, use of dogs or security cameras is recommended.

A turnstile (see Figure 10.5 ) is a form of gate that prevents more than one person at a time from gaining entry and often restricts movement in one direction. It is used to gain entry but not to exit, or vice versa. A turnstile is basically the fencing equivalent of a secured revolving door. A turnstile can be designed to turn freely to allow easy egress. An ingress turnstile can be implemented with a locking mechanism that requires personnel to provide a code, combination, or credential before it will allow a single person to enter the secured area. A turnstile can be used as a personnel flow control device to limit the direction of travel and the speed of access (i.e., only one person can pass at a time after valid authentication).

An access control vestibule (also known as a mantrap) is a double set of doors (also shown in Figure 10.5 ) that is often protected by a guard or some other physical layout that prevents piggybacking and can trap individuals at the discretion of security personnel. The purpose of an access control vestibule is to immobilize a subject until their identity and authentication authority are verified. If a subject is authorized for entry, the inner door opens, allowing entry into the facility or onto the premises. If a subject is not authorized, both doors remain closed and locked until an escort (typically a guard or a police officer) arrives to escort the subject off the property or arrest the subject for trespassing (this is known as a delay feature). Often an access control vestibule includes a scale to prevent piggybacking or tailgating. Access control vestibules can be used to control entrance into a facility or entrance within a facility to a higher secured area, such as a data center or an SCIF.

Another key element of physical security, especially for data centers, government facilities, and highly secure organizations, is security bollards , which prevent vehicles from ramming access points and entrances. These can be permanently fixed in place or automatically rise from their installed base at a fixed time or an alert. They are often disguised as planters or other architectural elements. See the previous discussion of CPTED in the “Facility Design” section.

Barricades , in addition to fencing, are used to control both foot traffic and vehicles. K-rails (often seen during road construction), large planters, zigzag queues, bollards, and tire shredders are all examples of barricades. When used properly, they can control crowds and prevent vehicles from being used to cause damage to your building. Long straight and unobstructed vehicle paths should be avoided in order to prevent the buildup of excessive speed. If generators and fuel storage are present, additional layers of barricade protection may be necessary to prevent tampering or destruction.

#### Lighting

Lighting is the most commonly used form of perimeter security control providing the security benefit of deterrence. The primary purpose of lighting is to discourage casual intruders, trespassers, prowlers, or would-be thieves who would rather perform their misdeeds, such as vandalism, theft, and loitering, in the dark. Both interior and exterior lighting should be implemented for security, especially related to parking areas, walkways, and entrances. Exterior lighting should generally be on from dusk until dawn. Interior lighting may be always on, switched manually, or triggered on demand, possibly via motion. Emergency lighting should be implemented in key areas (such as exits and escape routes) and triggered with the loss of power or along with a fire alarm. Lighting is often claimed to be the most commonly deployed physical security mechanism. However, lighting is only a deterrent and not a strong deterrent. It should not be used as the primary or sole protection mechanism except in areas with a low threat level. Your entire site, inside and out, should be well lit. This provides for easy identification of personnel and makes it easier to notice intrusions.

Lighting should not necessarily be used to illuminate the positions of guards, dogs, patrol posts, or other similar security elements. However, these can be illuminated if knowledge of their presence is to be used as a deterrent. Lighting should be combined with security guards, guard dogs, security cameras, or some other form of intrusion detection or surveillance mechanism. Lighting must not cause a nuisance or problem for nearby residents, roads, railways, airports, and so on. It should also never cause glare or reflective distraction to guards, dogs, and monitoring equipment, which could otherwise aid attackers during break-in attempts. Strong lights used to illuminate a building located on a fence line pointing inward can function as a means to hide intruders. Just think of standing in the dark with someone pointing a flashlight at you—you will be unable to see them because the light overpowers your vision.

It is generally accepted as a de facto standard that lighting used for perimeter protection should illuminate critical areas with at least 2 foot-candles of power (which is approximately 2 lumens, or 20 lux). Another common issue for the use of lighting is the placement of the lights. Standards seem to indicate that light poles should be placed the same distance apart as the diameter of the illuminated area created by illumination elements. Thus, if a lighted area is 40 feet in diameter, poles should be 40 feet apart. This light pole positioning allows for the intersection of lighted areas on the ground, thus preventing an intruder to gain access under the cover of darkness.

#### Security Guards and Guard Dogs

All physical security controls, whether static deterrents or active detection and surveillance mechanisms, ultimately rely on personnel to intervene and stop actual intrusions and attacks. Security guards exist to fulfill this need. Guards can be posted around a perimeter or inside to monitor access points or watch detection and surveillance monitors. The real benefit of guards is that they are able to adapt and react to various conditions or situations. Guards can learn and recognize attack and intrusion activities and patterns, can adjust to a changing environment, and can make decisions and judgment calls. Security guards are often an appropriate security control when immediate situation handling and decision making on site is necessary.

Guards should perform patrols both internally and externally to look for security violations, unauthorized entities, or other abnormalities throughout the facility and campus grounds. Patrols should be frequent, but at random intervals. This prevents an intruder from observing a pattern of patrols and then timing their break-in accordingly.

Unfortunately, using security guards is not a perfect solution. There are numerous disadvantages to deploying, maintaining, and relying on security guards. Not all environments and facilities support security guards. This may be because of actual human incompatibility or the layout, design, location, and construction of the facility. Not all security guards are themselves reliable. Prescreening, bonding, and training do not guarantee that you won't end up with an ineffective or unreliable security guard.

Even if a guard is initially reliable, guards are subject to physical injury and illness, take vacations, can become distracted, are vulnerable to social engineering, and may become unemployable because of substance abuse. In addition, security guards usually offer protection only up to the point at which their life is endangered. Additionally, security guards are usually unaware of the scope of the operations within a facility and are therefore not thoroughly equipped to know how to respond to every situation. Though this is considered a disadvantage, the lack of knowledge of the scope of the operations within a facility can also be considered an advantage, because this supports confidentiality of those operations and thus helps reduce the possibility that a security guard will be involved in the disclosure of confidential information. Finally, security guards are expensive whether they are employees or provided by a third-party contractor.

Guard dogs can be an alternative to security guards. They can often be deployed as a perimeter security control. As a detection and deterrent, dogs are extremely effective. However, dogs are costly, require a high level of maintenance, and impose serious insurance and liability requirements.

Robot sentries can be used to automatically patrol an area to look for anything out of place. Robot sentries often use facial recognition to identity authorized individuals as well as potentially identify intruders. Robot sentries can be on wheels or be a type of drone.

### Internal Security Controls

If a facility is designed with restricted areas to control physical security, a mechanism to handle visitors is required. Often an escort is assigned to visitors, and their access and activities are monitored closely. Failing to track the actions of outsiders when they are allowed into a protected area can result in malicious activity against the most protected assets. Visitor control can also benefit from the use of keys, combination locks, badges, motion detectors, intrusion alarms, and more.

Reception can be used as a choke point to block access to unauthorized visitors. The reception area should be segregated from the security areas with locked doors and monitored by security cameras. If a visitor is authorized, then an escort can be assigned to accompany them around the facility. If a valid worker arrives, the receptionist may be able to “buzz” the door open for them. Any unauthorized visitors can be asked to leave, security guards can be brought to bear, or police can be called.

Visitor logs are a manual or automated list of nonemployee entries or access to a facility or location. Employee logs may also be useful for access tracking and verification. Logs of physical access should be maintained. These can be created automatically through the use of smartcards or manually by a security guard. The physical access logs establish context for the interpretation of logical logs. Logs are helpful in an emergency to determine whether everyone has escaped a building safely.

#### Keys and Combination Locks

Locks keep closed doors closed. They are designed and deployed to prevent access to everyone without proper authorization. A lock is a crude form of an identification and authorization mechanism. If you possess the correct key or combination, you are considered authorized and permitted entry. Key-based locks are the most common and inexpensive forms of physical access control devices. These are often known as preset locks , deadbolt locks, or conventional locks. These types of locks are subject to lock picking , which is often categorized under a class of lock mechanism attacks called shimming . Many conventional locks are also vulnerable to an attack known as bumping. Bumping is accomplished using a special bump key that when properly tapped or bumped causes the lock pins to jump and allows the cylinder to turn. (To see how these lock attacks are performed, watch videos from www.youtube.com/c/HelpfulLockPicker and www.youtube.com/c/lockpickinglawyer .)

Programmable or combination locks offer a broader range of control than preset locks. Some programmable locks can be configured with multiple valid access combinations or may include digital or electronic controls employing keypads, smartcards, or cipher devices. For instance, an electronic access control (EAC) lock incorporates three elements: an electromagnet to keep the door closed, a credential reader to authenticate subjects and to disable the electromagnet, and a sensor to reengage the electromagnet when the door is closed. An EAC can monitor the amount of time that a door stays open in order to trigger a warning buzzer if a door stays open for longer than 5 seconds and trigger an intrusion alarm if the door stays open for longer than 10 seconds (times are examples, not prescriptions).

Locks serve as an alternative to security guards as a perimeter entrance access control device. A gate or door can be opened and closed to allow access by a security guard who verifies your identity before granting access, or the lock itself can serve as the verification device that also grants or restricts entry.

#### Environment and Life Safety

An important aspect of physical access control and maintaining the security of a facility is protecting the basic elements of the environment and protecting human life. In all circumstances and under all conditions, the most important aspect of security is protecting people. Thus, preventing harm to people is the most important goal for all security solutions.

Part of maintaining safety for personnel is maintaining the basic environment of a facility. For short periods of time, people can survive without water, food, air conditioning, and power. But in some cases, the loss of these elements can have disastrous results, or they can be symptoms of more immediate and dangerous problems. Flooding, fires, release of toxic materials, and natural disasters all threaten human life as well as the stability of a facility. Physical security procedures should focus on protecting human life and then on restoring the safety of the environment and restoring the utilities necessary for the IT infrastructure to function.

People should always be your top priority. Only after personnel are safe can you consider addressing business continuity. Many organizations adopt occupant emergency plans (OEPs) to guide and assist with sustaining personnel safety in the wake of a disaster. The OEP provides guidance on how to minimize threats to life, prevent injury, manage duress, handle travel, provide for safety monitoring, and protect property from damage due to a destructive physical event. The OEP does not address IT issues or business continuity, just personnel and general property. The business continuity plan (BCP) and disaster recovery plan (DRP) address IT and business continuity and recovery issues.

#### Regulatory Requirements

Every organization operates within a certain industry and jurisdiction. Both of these entities (and possibly additional ones) impose legal requirements, restrictions, and regulations on the practices of organizations that fall within their realm. These legal requirements can apply to licensed use of software, hiring restrictions, handling of sensitive materials, and compliance with safety regulations.

Complying with all applicable legal requirements is a key part of sustaining security. The legal requirements for an industry and a country (and often also a state and city) must be considered a baseline or foundation on which the remainder of the security infrastructure is built.

### Key Performance Indicators of Physical Security

Key performance indicators (KPIs) of physical security should be determined, monitored, recorded, and evaluated. KPIs are metrics or measurements of the operation of or the failure of various aspects of physical security. The goal of the use of KPIs is to assess the effectiveness of security efforts. Only with such information can management make informed decisions on altering existing security operations in order to achieve a higher level of effective security protection. Keep in mind the overall goal of security is to reduce risk so that the organization's objectives can be achieved in a cost-effective manner.

Here are common and potential examples of physical security KPIs:

- Number of successful intrusions

- Number of successful crimes

- Number of successful incidents

- Number of successful disruptions

- Number of unsuccessful intrusions

- Number of unsuccessful crimes

- Number of unsuccessful incidents

- Number of unsuccessful disruptions

- Time to detect incidents

- Time to assess incidents

- Time to respond to incidents

- Time to recover from incidents

- Time to restore normal conditions after incident

- Level of organizational impact of incidents

- Number of false positives (i.e., false detection alerts/alarms)

A baseline should be established for each KPI and a record maintained of each measurement. This historical record and baseline are necessary to perform trend analysis and gain an understanding of the performance of the physical security mechanisms. Automatically collected KPIs are often preferred, since they will be recorded reliably. However, manual KPI measurements are often more important, but they require attention and focus to collect. Each incident response operation (even if a BCP and DRP level issue), should conclude with a lessons learned phase where/when any additional KPI related information is gathered or determined and recorded. With reliable KPI assessment, organizations can identify deficiencies, assess improvements, evaluate response measures, and perform return on security investment (ROSI) and cost/benefit analysis for physical security controls.
