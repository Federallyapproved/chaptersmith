## Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)

A content distribution network (CDN) , or content delivery network , is a collection of resource services deployed in numerous data centers across the internet in order to provide low latency, high performance, and high availability of the hosted content. CDNs provide the desired multimedia performance quality demanded by customers through the concept of distributed data hosts. Rather than having media content stored in a single central location to be transmitted to all parts of the internet, the media is distributed to numerous geographically distributed pre-staging internet locations that are closer to groups of customers. This results in a type of geographic and logical load balancing (see Chapter 12 ). No one server or cluster of servers will be strained under the load of all resource requests, and the hosting servers are located closer to the requesting customers. The overall result is lower-latency and higher-quality throughput. There are many CDN service providers, including Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, CacheFly, and Level 3 Communications.

Although most CDNs focus on the physical distribution of servers, client-based CDN is also possible. This is often referred as P2P (peer-to-peer) . The most widely recognized P2P CDN is BitTorrent.
