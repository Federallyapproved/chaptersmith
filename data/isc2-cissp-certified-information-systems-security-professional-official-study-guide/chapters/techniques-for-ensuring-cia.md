## Techniques for Ensuring CIA

To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data, you must ensure that all components that have access to data are secure and well behaved. Software designers use different techniques to ensure that programs do only what is required and nothing more. Although the concepts we discuss in the following sections all relate to software programs, they are also commonly used in all areas of security. For example, physical confinement guarantees that all physical access to hardware is controlled.

### Confinement

Software designers use process confinement to restrict the actions of a program. Simply put, process confinement allows a process to read from and write to only certain memory locations and resources. This is also known as sandboxing . It is the application of the principle of least privilege to processes. The goal of confinement is to prevent data leakage to unauthorized programs, users, or systems.

The operating system, or some other security component, disallows illegal read/write requests. If a process attempts to initiate an action beyond its granted authority, that action will be denied. In addition, further actions, such as logging the violation attempt, may be taken. Generally, the offending process is terminated. Confinement can be implemented in the operating system itself (such as through process isolation and memory protection), through the use of a confinement application or service (for example, Sandboxie at sandboxie.com ), or through a virtualization or hypervisor solution (such as VMware or Oracle's VirtualBox).

### Bounds

Each process that runs on a system is assigned an authority level. The authority level tells the operating system what the process can do. In simple systems, there may be only two authority levels: user and kernel. The authority level tells the operating system how to set the bounds for a process. The bounds of a process consist of limits set on the memory addresses and resources it can access. The bounds state the area within which a process is confined or contained. In most systems, these bounds segment logical areas of memory for each process to use. It is the responsibility of the operating system to enforce these logical bounds and to disallow access to other processes. More secure systems may require physically bounded processes. Physical bounds require each bounded process to run in an area of memory that is physically separated from other bounded processes, not just logically bounded in the same memory space. Physically bounded memory can be very expensive, but it's also more secure than logical bounds. Bounds can be a means to enforce confinement.

### Isolation

When a process is confined through enforcing access bounds, that process runs in isolation. Process isolation ensures that any behavior will affect only the memory and resources associated with the isolated process. Isolation is used to protect the operating environment, the kernel of the operating system, and other independent applications. Isolation is an essential component of a stable operating system. Isolation is what prevents an application from accessing the memory or resources of another application, whether for good or ill. Isolation allows for a fail-soft environment so that separate processes can operate normally or fail/crash without interfering or affecting other processes. Isolation is achieved through the enforcement of containment using bounds. Hardware and software isolation implementations are discussed throughout Chapter 9 .

These three concepts (confinement, bounds, and isolation) make designing secure programs and operating systems more difficult, but they also make it possible to implement more secure systems. Confinement is making sure that an active process can only access specific resources (such as memory). Bounds is the limitation of authorization assigned to a process to limit the resources the process can interact with and the types of interactions allowed. Isolation is the means by which confinement is implemented through the use of bounds. The goals of the concepts is the ensure that the predetermined scope of resource access is not violated and any failure or compromise of a process has minimal to no affect on any other process.

### Access Controls

To ensure the security of a system, you need to allow subjects to access only authorized objects. Access controls limit the access of a subject to an object. Access rules state which objects are valid for each subject. Further, an object might be valid for one type of access and be invalid for another type of access. There are a wide range of options for access controls, such as discretionary, role-based, and mandatory. Please see Chapter 14 for an in-depth discussion of access controls.

### Trust and Assurance

A trusted system is one in which all protection mechanisms work together to process sensitive data for many types of users while maintaining a stable and secure computing environment. In other words, trust is the presence of a security mechanism, function, or capability. Assurance is the degree of confidence in satisfaction of security needs. In other words, assurance is how reliable the security mechanisms are at providing security. Assurance must be continually maintained, updated, and reverified. This is true if the secured system experiences a known change (good or badâ€”i.e., a vendor patch or a malicious exploit) or if a significant amount of time has passed. In either case, change has occurred at some level. Change is often the antithesis of security; it often diminishes security. This is why change management, patch management, and configuration management are so important to security management.

Assurance varies from one system to another and often must be established on individual systems. However, there are grades or levels of assurance that can be placed across numerous systems of the same type, systems that support the same services, or systems that are deployed in the same geographic location. Thus, trust can be built into a system by implementing specific security features, whereas assurance is an assessment of the reliability and usability of those security features in a real-world situation.
