## Chapter 2: Personnel Security and Risk Management Concepts

- Possible answers include job descriptions, principle of least privilege, separation of duties, job responsibilities, job rotation/cross-training, performance reviews, background checks, job action warnings, awareness, training, job training, exit interviews/terminations, nondisclosure agreements, employment agreements, privacy declaration, and acceptable use policies.

- The formulas and values for quantitative risk assessment are as follows: AV = $ EF = % loss SLE = AV * EF ARO = # / yr ALE = SLE * ARO or AV * EF * ARO Cost/benefit = (ALE1 – ALE2) – ACS

- AV = $

- EF = % loss

- SLE = AV * EF

- ARO = # / yr

- ALE = SLE * ARO or AV * EF * ARO

- Cost/benefit = (ALE1 – ALE2) – ACS

- The Delphi technique is an anonymous feedback-and-response process used to enable a group to reach an anonymous consensus. Its primary purpose is to elicit honest and uninfluenced responses from all participants. The participants are usually gathered into a single meeting room. For each request for feedback, each participant writes down their response on paper or through digital messaging services anonymously. The results are compiled and presented to the group for evaluation. The process is repeated until a consensus is reached. The goal or purpose of the Delphi technique is to facilitate the evaluation of ideas, concepts, and solutions on their own merit without the discrimination that often occurs based on who the idea comes from.

- Risk assessment often involves a hybrid approach using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A purely quantitative analysis is not possible; not all elements and aspects of the analysis can be quantified because some are qualitative, some are subjective, and some are intangible. Since a purely quantitative risk assessment is not possible, balancing the results of a quantitative analysis is essential. The method of combining quantitative and qualitative analysis into a final assessment of organizational risk is known as hybrid assessment or hybrid analysis.

- The common social engineering principles are authority, intimidation, consensus, scarcity, familiarity, trust, and urgency.

- Possible answers include eliciting information, pretexting, prepending, phishing, spear phishing, business email compromise (BEC), whaling, smishing, vishing, spam, shoulder surfing, invoice scams, hoaxes, impersonation, masquerading, tailgating, piggybacking, dumpster diving, identity fraud, typo squatting, influence campaigns, hybrid warfare, and social media abuse.
