## Supply Chain Risk Management

Applying risk-based management concepts to the supply chain is a means to ensure a more robust and successful security strategy in organizations of all sizes. A supply chain is the concept that most computers, devices, networks, systems, and even cloud services are not built by a single entity. In fact, most of the companies we know of as computer and equipment manufacturers generally perform the final assembly rather than manufacture all the individual components. Often the CPU, memory, drive controllers, hard drives, SSDs, and video cards are created by other third-party vendors. Even these commodity vendors are unlikely to have mined their own metals or processed the oil for plastics or etched the silicon of their chips. Thus, any finished system has a long and complex history, known as its supply chain, that enabled it to come into existence.

Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is the means to ensure that all of the vendors or links in the supply chain are reliable, trustworthy, reputable organizations that disclose their practices and security requirements to their business partners (although not necessarily to the public). Each link in the chain should be responsible and accountable to the next link in the chain. Each handoff is properly organized, documented, managed, and audited. The goal of a secure supply chain is to ensure that the finished product is of sufficient quality, meets performance and operational goals, and provides stated security mechanisms, and that at no point in the process was any element counterfeited or subjected to unauthorized or malicious manipulation or sabotage.

When evaluating organizational risk, consider external factors that can affect the organization, especially related to company stability and resource availability. The supply chain can be a threat vector, where materials, software, hardware, or data is being obtained from a supposedly trusted source but the supply chain behind that source could have been compromised and the asset poisoned or modified.

An organization's supply chain should be assessed to determine what risks it places on the organization. Is the organization operating on a just-in-time basis where materials are delivered just before or just as they are needed by manufacturing? If there is any delay in delivery, is there any surplus or buffer of materials that can be used to maintain production while the supply chain operations are reconstituted?

Most organizations rely on products manufactured by other entities. Most of those products are produced as part of a long and complex supply chain. Attacks on that supply chain could result in flawed or less reliable products or could allow for remote access or listening mechanisms to be embedded into otherwise functioning equipment.

Supply chain attacks present a risk that can be challenging to address. An organization may elect to inspect all equipment in order to reduce the chance of modified devices going into production networks. However, with miniaturization, it may be nearly impossible to discover an extra chip placed on a device's mainboard. Also, the manipulation may be through firmware or software instead of hardware. Organizations can choose to source products from trusted and reputable vendors, or maybe even attempt to use vendors who manufacture most of their products domestically.

In many cases, ongoing security monitoring, management, and assessment may be required. This could be an industry best practice or a regulation. Such assessment and monitoring of a supply chain may be performed by the primary or end-of-chain organization or may require the use of external auditors. When engaging third-party assessment and monitoring services, keep in mind that each element of the supply chain entity needs to show security-mindedness in their business operations. If an organization is unable to manage their own operations on a secure basis, how can they provide reliable security management functions to the supply chain?

When possible, establish minimum security requirements for each entity in a supply chain. The security requirements for new hardware, software, or services should always meet or exceed the security expected in the final product. This often requires a detailed review of SLAs, contracts, and actual performance. This is to ensure that security is a prescribed component of the contracted services. When a supply chain component provider is crafting software or providing a service (such as a cloud provider), then a service-level requirement (SLR) may need to be defined. An SLR is a statement of the expectations of service and performance from the product or service of a vendor. Often, an SLR is provided by the customer/client prior to the establishment of the SLA (which should incorporate the elements of the SLR if the vendor expects the customer to sign the agreement).
