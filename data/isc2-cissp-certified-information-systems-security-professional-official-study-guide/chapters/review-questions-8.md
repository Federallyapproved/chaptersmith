What part of the TCB concept validates access to every resource prior to granting the requested access? TCB partition Trusted library Reference monitor Security kernel

- TCB partition

- Trusted library

- Reference monitor

- Security kernel

- A security model provides a way for designers to map abstract statements into a solution that prescribes the algorithms and data structures necessary to build hardware and software. Thus, a security model gives software designers something against which to measure their design and implementation. Which of the following is the best definition of a security model? A security model states policies an organization must follow. A security model provides a framework to implement a security policy. A security model is a technical evaluation of each part of a computer system to assess its concordance with security standards. A security model is used to host one or more operating systems within the memory of a single host computer or to run applications that are not compatible with the host OS.

- The state machine model describes a system that is always secure no matter what state it is in. A secure state machine model system always boots into a secure state, maintains a secure state across all transitions, and allows subjects to access resources only in a secure manner compliant with the security policy.

- A new operating system update has made significant changes to the prior system. While testing, you discover that the system is highly unstable, allows for integrity violations between applications, can be affected easily by local denial-of-service attacks, and allows for information disclosure between processes.
