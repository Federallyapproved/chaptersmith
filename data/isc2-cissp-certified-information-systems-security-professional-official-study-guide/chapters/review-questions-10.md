## Review Questions

- Your organization is planning on building a new facility to house a majority of on-site workers. The current facility has had numerous security issues, such as loitering, theft, graffiti, and even a few physical altercations between employees and nonemployees. The CEO has asked you to assist in developing the facility plan to reduce these security concerns. While researching options you discover the concepts of CPTED. Which of the following is not one of its core strategies? Natural territorial reinforcement Natural access control Natural training and enrichment Natural surveillance

- Natural territorial reinforcement

- Natural access control

- Natural training and enrichment

- What method is a systematic effort to identify relationships between mission-critical applications, processes, and operations and all the necessary supporting elements when evaluating the security of a facility or designing a new facility? Log file audit Critical path analysis Risk analysis Taking inventory

- Which of the following is a true statement in regard to security cameras? (Choose all that apply.) Cameras should be positioned to watch exit and entry points allowing any change in authorization or access level. Cameras are not needed around valuable assets and resources as well as to provide additional protection in public areas such as parking structures and walkways. Cameras should be positioned to have clear sight lines of all exterior walls, entrance and exit points, and interior hallways. Security cameras should only be overt and obvious in order to provide a deterrent benefit. Security cameras have a fixed area of view for recording. Some camera systems include a system on a chip (SoC) or embedded components and may be able to perform various specialty functions, such as time-lapse recording, tracking, facial recognition, object detection, or infrared or color-filtered recording. Motion detection or sensing cameras can always distinguish between humans and animals.
