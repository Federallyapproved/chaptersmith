## Summary

Several basic security principles are at the core of security operations in any environment. These include need to know, least privilege, separation of duties and responsibilities, job rotation and mandatory vacations, privileged account management, and service level agreements (SLAs). Combined, these practices help prevent security incidents from occurring and limit the scope of incidents that do occur.

When addressing personnel safety and security, safety of personnel should always be a high priority. Duress systems allow guards to raise silent alarms in response to emergencies, and emergency management plans help the organization respond to disasters. Traveling presents unique risks to employees, such as the loss of data, malware installed on unattended systems, and intercepted data when using free Wi-Fi networks. Safety training and awareness programs ensure that personnel know the various risks and ways to mitigate them.

Asset management extends beyond media to any asset considered valuable to an organization. This includes both tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets include hardware and software, and organizations commonly inventory these assets to track them. Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and organizations track these assets as well.

With resource protection, media and other assets that contain data are protected throughout their lifecycle. Media includes anything that can hold data, such as tapes, internal drives, portable drives, CDs and DVDs, mobile devices, memory cards, and printouts. Media holding sensitive information should be marked, handled, stored, and destroyed using methods that are acceptable within the organization.

Managed services in the cloud include any resources stored in or accessed via the cloud. When negotiating with cloud service providers, you must understand who is responsible for maintenance and security. In general, the cloud service provider has the most responsibility with software as a service (SaaS) resources, less responsibility with platform as a service (PaaS) offerings, and the least responsibility with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offerings. Cloud services commonly provide elasticity, which is the ability of services to dynamically respond to changing workload requirements.

Change and configuration management are two additional controls that help reduce outages. Configuration management ensures that systems are deployed in a consistent manner that is known to be secure. Imaging is a common configuration management technique that ensures that systems start with a known baseline. Change management helps reduce unintended outages from unauthorized changes and can also help prevent changes from weakening security.

Patch and vulnerability management procedures work together to keep systems protected against known vulnerabilities. Patch management keeps systems up to date with relevant patches. Vulnerability management includes vulnerability scans to check for a wide variety of known vulnerabilities (including unpatched systems).
