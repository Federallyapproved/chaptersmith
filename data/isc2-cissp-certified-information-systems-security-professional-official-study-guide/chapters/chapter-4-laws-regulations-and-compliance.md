## Chapter 4: Laws, Regulations, and Compliance

- C. The Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce sets regulations on the export of encryption products outside of the United States. The other agencies listed here are not involved in regulating exports.

- A. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) includes provisions regulating information security at federal agencies. It places authority for classified systems in the hands of the National Security Agency (NSA) and authority for all other systems with the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).

- D. Administrative laws do not require an act of the legislative branch to implement at the federal level. Administrative laws consist of the policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by agencies of the executive branch of government. Although they do not require an act of Congress, these laws are subject to judicial review and must comply with criminal and civil laws enacted by the legislative branch.

- A. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018 was the first sweeping data privacy law enacted by a U.S. state. This follows California's passing of the first data breach notification law, which was modeled after the requirements of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

- B. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) required that communications carriers assist law enforcement with the implementation of wiretaps when done under an appropriate court order. CALEA only applies to communications carriers and does not apply to financial institutions, healthcare organizations, or websites.

- B. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution sets the “probable cause” standard that law enforcement officers must follow when conducting searches and/or seizures of private property. It also states that those officers must obtain a warrant before gaining involuntary access to such property. The Privacy Act regulates what information government agencies may collect and maintain about individuals. The Second Amendment grants the right to keep and bear arms. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act regulates financial institutions, not the federal government.

- A. Copyright law is the only type of intellectual property protection available to Matthew. It covers only the specific software code that Matthew used. It does not cover the process or ideas behind the software. Trademark protection is not appropriate for this type of situation because it would only protect the name and/or logo of the software, not its algorithms. Patent protection does not apply to mathematical algorithms. Matthew can't seek trade secret protection because he plans to publish the algorithm in a public technical journal.

- D. Mary and Joe should treat their oil formula as a trade secret. As long as they do not publicly disclose the formula, they can keep it a company secret indefinitely. Copyright and patent protection both have expiration dates and would not meet Mary and Joe's requirements. Trademark protection is for names and logos and would not be appropriate in this case.

- C. Richard's product name should be protected under trademark law. Until his registration is granted, he can use the ™ symbol next to it to inform others that it is protected under trademark law. Once his application is approved, the name becomes a registered trademark, and Richard can begin using the ® symbol. The © symbol is used to represent a copyright. The † symbol is not associated with intellectual property protections.

- A. The Privacy Act of 1974 limits the ways government agencies may use information that private citizens disclose to them under certain circumstances. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) implements safeguards against electronic eavesdropping. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulates the protection and sharing of health records. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act requires that financial institutions protect customer records.

- D. The European Union provides standard contractual clauses that may be used to facilitate data transfer. That would be the best choice in a case where two different companies are sharing data. If the data were being shared internally within a company, binding corporate rules would also be an option. The EU/US Privacy Shield was a safe harbor agreement that would previously have allowed the transfer but that is no longer valid. Privacy Lock is a made-up term.

- A. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) provides severe penalties for companies that collect information from young children without parental consent. COPPA states that this consent must be obtained from the parents of children younger than the age of 13 before any information is collected (other than basic information required to obtain that consent).

- D. Although state data breach notification laws vary, they generally apply to Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, state identification card numbers, credit/debit card numbers, and bank account numbers. These laws generally do not cover other identifiers, such as a student identification number.

- B. Organizations subject to HIPAA may enter into relationships with service providers as long as the provider's use of protected health information is regulated under a formal business associate agreement (BAA). The BAA makes the service provider liable under HIPAA.

- B. Cloud services almost always include binding click-through license agreements that the user may have agreed to when signing up for the service. If that is the case, the user may have bound the organization to the terms of that agreement. This agreement does not need to be in writing. There is no indication that the user violated any laws.

- B. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) provides, among other things, regulations regarding the way financial institutions can handle private information belonging to their customers.

- C. U.S. patent law provides for an exclusivity period of 20 years beginning at the time a utility patent application is submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office.

- C. Ryan does not likely need to be concerned about HIPAA compliance because that law applies to healthcare organizations and Ryan works for a financial institution. Instead, he should be more concerned about compliance with the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA). The other concerns should all be part of Ryan's contract review.

- C. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to organizations involved in storing, transmitting, and processing credit card information.

- D. Copyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the death of the last surviving author of the work.
