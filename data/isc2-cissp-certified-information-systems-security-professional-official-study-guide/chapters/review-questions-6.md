## Review Questions

- Ryan is responsible for managing the cryptographic keys used by his organization. Which of the following statements are correct about how he should select and manage those keys? (Choose all that apply.) Keys should be sufficiently long to protect against future attacks if the data is expected to remain sensitive. Keys should be chosen using an approach that generates them from a predictable pattern. Keys should be maintained indefinitely. Longer keys provide greater levels of security.
